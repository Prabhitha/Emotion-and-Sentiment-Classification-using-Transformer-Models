20	It was never about comparisons, it was about our experiences and relationship to capitalists here.
0	Still the greatest timeline tho
0	I agree with you! Just wishful thinking from me I guess aha!
20	I blame all of y'all, y'all told [him he] was funny
9	[NAME], feel bad for that streamer, everyone has their moments on this game, it‚Äôs understandable
20	For futures sake, if someone is in the Midwest, where would we opt to play? 
2	Ok. Hang onto shit you can't change and be whiney about it. This is a reason why we catch shit. We can't take it
10	No need to apologize. It definitely put things in perspective. I‚Äôm just glad your DD ended up ok.
21	Don't worry, you'll find love, I promise! I hope you love yourself as well. <3
23	Kinda reminds me of Arctic Monkeys' 'Favourite Worst Nightmare' cover art
7	I'm curious - are you under the age of 30?
3	Oh cool another manufactured awful [NAME] pushing untalented rapper. It‚Äôs getting more obvious as time goes by
20	I‚Äôm sorta okay with the chicken but the sauce part is downright chaotic
18	Drop it off at a tent city or homeless camp. I've done it with an old Adirondak chair and they seemed to love it.
4	[NAME] YES!!!
20	Women aren‚Äôt men. We don‚Äôt need multiple sexual partners the way men do.
3	Poeling is looking like a fkn stud. Imagine our C depth next season... [NAME]... holy fuck
18	Truer words were never typed. Loved that game.
20	Sorrow. Sorrow.
15	Seconded! [NAME] is gorgeous.
20	But then you missed their officiant who looks and sounds like [NAME]! ü§≠üò≥ü§£ 
20	And then they claim that being incels have nothing to do with their personalities.
5	You're not from America, are you? Bless your pure soul <3 
20	No idea man. Go check that one ‚Äústudy‚Äù done thirty years ago where you got that 40% from.
4	It is his welcome, he can do with it as he wishes. Your misunderstanding is forgiven.
20	Actually it can be useful when 2 people or so use the carbine for crowd control .
7	yeah i want to see what kind of car it is post pics :)
3	Well I‚Äôm hyped.
3	He said i am being rude to her
20	[NAME] gets eliminated the 3rd time she's in the bottom so this is wrong and [NAME] would have the best track record if this is true
20	"Result of ""I have camera so I'm invincible"" syndrome."
10	Maybe unpopular but I never eat pancakes with syrup. Way too damn sweet.
20	>Feminism is how we get to equality how do you know that?
23	I thought the sane until I got threatening emails from HR
20	He had been so worried that the stepmom would have a hard time integrating into the family.
6	Was hoping for a per bear on the other side, or maybe a running woodchipper.
20	Sweet [NAME] of Haiti..it does! I no longer burn paperwork like I used to, and *I* can see it. EDIT: Hermes-talk
18	This is my bestie's favorite song.
2	Great fucking game for [NAME]. And I can't believe some people are trying to hate on him for one TOV in the 4th. This fan base smh
18	This was so touching ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5	Why are we making fun of a little kid? He probably hasnt even the ability to grow a neckbeard yet.
21	I hope you like it-
10	Don't listen to much prog or hardcore, I love some black metal though.
0	I had hot dogs. They were delicious, lol!

0	This is gold!!!!! Im impressed. Very accurate.
8	Professionally.... no way I could do that to myself
21	I got into law school, and now I‚Äôm finally tackling my addiction to video games to make sure I graduate :) 
20	Nice try Lumi
15	Hey, thanks for clarifying. I was trying to find news online without any luck.
1	You played yourself
20	Insta/fastmine scam, but yeah, scam none the less.
7	Om [NAME], who kets their dog fight a croc? 
23	Well, flash bangs go bang, too, to temporarily deafen and disorient, so there's that.
7	Cool shot. Super wide angle, multi shot?
9	He was in the merge lane and should have yielded. He was legally in the wrong.
20	Actually someone already said goodbye so checkmate idiot
20	I haven't seen it but it's on my list!!
7	wait. So most of south asia doesn't eat rice?
23	They do, however this is a TRAFFIC unit that focus' on TRAFFIC offences. Ice dealers are more of a detective / taskforce job.
0	That‚Äôs awesome. They did it on purpose.
20	I actually have to try, to see what happens
3	"""Being able to attract women"" shouldn't be the only way you rate how good a person is. That's ridiculous."
3	Oy! NOW THAT'S REALLY PISSED IT OFF!!
0	With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
20	Nope. Are we at the name calling stage? And here I thought we were getting along.
4	True. I think the only way vegan lab-grown meat could be produced is via self-renewing stem cells which is still a very undeveloped technology
20	Is [NAME] somewhere on Apple Music? I can‚Äôt find her
9	The reaction is incredible. I‚Äôm quite certain it‚Äôs satire as well, but its impact is depressing as hell. 
5	ELABORATE plz!!!!
3	Who tf told you that weirdo is left?
4	I thought it got a nerf when the spirit got released. My bad. But I still stand by, healing against the legion is pointless. 
20	Protip: you probably meant that you COULDN'T care less.
25	And I've no monkeys left.... Sorry man
6	> What plans should I use to hide the scent of a decaying body? Can you bottle up his farts? Seriously.
10	"I just hate the ""I don't know"" people"
4	Yeah agreed, it‚Äôs great to see!
0	Wow it looks like we held our own negotiating here, nice to see.

11	[NAME] isn't secretly homophobic he is openly homophobic
11	nah.....anime is weird
6	Is that meat or veggies?
15	Thanks for keep us posted

17	Abortion. emails. BENGHAZI! red cups Happy Holidays
4	Yeah I know a lot of people fail to realize it or at least right away
6	So you're male then. Ps ur wrong bud
2	Sue the shit out of her for damages to your private property.
20	"That's why I said ""much"" instead of ""most"" ... 70 is still 5 over 65."
20	Ice in his veins... D'L‚ùÑ
19	No no! I meant it in a positive way. The emotional rollercoaster of the photo album.
20	It looks like a quail egg and it‚Äôs actually on a plate a weird looking plate but still a plate.
8	I hope not, i was just sharing what happened to my bud. GL man, hope you get it figured out
20	Someone who's done very little to earn your ire. Did I piss in your cornflakes?
4	I like this one
26	[NAME] is getting very unhinged I almost feel bad for him at this point
20	Send it!
0	I appreciate your honesty.
26	Sad/Sweet for her to put in the effort to fake it!
17	This South Florida girl loves Jaxons Ice Cream. Seeing the kitchen sink makes me want to drive home.
8	To be fair, spinners are supposed to be very small pornstars, not BBW like trump.
20	That kid comes out of nowhere, it looks like he appeared right next to the woman like he teleported. 
10	I dont think she knows that once your body runs out of fat it starts eating your muscles and organs.
20	Couldnt find this one in google, where abouts is it?
3	Oh, [NAME], don't bring THAT story up!
1	She was sorry too, after I found out and ripped her a new one. LOL
20	This only makes me want him more. Proves he is decisive and has self belief. Our team has been devoid of both.
3	Ur mom causes a 2.6 just getting out of bed in the morning amirite?
23	And evidently [NAME] has a weak stomach. Ha.
27	Oh look a player breaking out of a slump against Dallas. Haven't seen this one before
20	"Verify yourself already or we will continue to ""spit negativity"""
0	Shes stunning haha
0	This is the single most wholesome thing I've seen on reddit. Proud.
9	This was diabolical. This is our Ulema. Wonder where we went wrong...
3	Mine is 2.5 and trying to drop her last nap. She needs it so desperately though. It is HELLLLLL dealing with this.
20	I speak so slowly, and i sometimes take break between words and sentences
1	You must be fun at parties
13	soon i‚Äôll have an army of karens and no one will be able to stop me

20	ROLL THE DICE
26	BPA not fit especially when we dont have a good team
20	[NAME] for comments on matches.
3	Oh man, you got me there with the image
0	This would be better posed in r/GCdebatesQT, thank you.
7	> so I would never say that to someone *To* someone, or *about* someone?
1	This is honestly the cherry on top of the cake with this story. That's absolutely hilarious!
20	Ah that's my school but I have yet to see this one, gotta keep swippin 
27	I'm rank 6 and get destroyed for using legion, what build do you use? I absolutely love legion just here getting ran over
9	Because it's straight up untrue. It's a new ce idea but anyone relying on the sentiment is going to be repeatedly disappointed.
3	They ate not hot, they are just annoyingly humid.
4	When you live where it's this cold, incessant complaining is a national pass time.
5	In the least condescending way possible I think you have some gross misconceptions and I'd like to clear them up.
9	Jolex because [NAME] grated on my nerves so bad
20	Do women make the razor blade choices for their spouses? I guess they could aim for that demographic.
15	I'm so glad I grew up playing a shooter made for kids rather than a shooter made for kids.
5	I have a long term plan. I appreciate the concern.
0	This is awesome! do you have any more artwork on a website or social site? Is this for sale!?
5	Get your mom professional help. Any grow person who runs away from their own home afterargument definitely has mental health issues
27	Is that [NAME]?
15	Thanks! I ordered some and let them know I'm traveling so I think I'm pretty set
18	I loooooove Tiff!!!
0	Man that movie is such a classic
10	I would enjoy this if it had a few more pixels.
20	Cheers mate.
24	We don't care as much for 69. Hard to do properly. Glad it works for you. We prefer to take turns.
0	[NAME], with his 8th appearance he's the most veteran player there
5	I'd be able to give you more helpful advice if you could be a little more clear with your situation and what you're asking.
27	Wow the [NAME] replies appeared in less than ten minutes this time!
3	Ok you're a little homophobic

0	I both loathe and applaud you
0	There are [NAME] fans on this subreddit. Awesome
11	Woke up feeling smug that I am off until Wednesday... Then I saw all the text messages, emails, and Skype messages. Fuuuuuuck. 
20	/uj I would've thought this was pics had it not been for your commie t
7	So sad‚Äîbut not surprising. It would be interesting to know if there‚Äôs a difference between countries with and without socialised health care.
24	No worries. Just giving you a hard time!
10	A lawyer is not going to disclose anything to random users, you guys are delusional
10	imagine if this was [NAME] people would lose their shit
10	She does have a great ass I‚Äôve always thought so
6	Why is it shocking? All professional sports is all about bottom line first-period!
10	Wait that... that doesn‚Äôt happen
10	"Thats not him :( the most recent comment literally starts with ""i'm not a dude"" "
4	Very well said.
3	SJW's I've encountered were far more trivial and spiteful in general.
14	Don‚Äôt worry! I was never convicted of anything!
0	Ooh, the pupil proportion was wonderful at this time.
26	If I have to watch Canada lose in a shootout I'm gonna lose it
20	It makes me wonder if Old Money New England families are into their own cousins a bit much.
6	Hey, [NAME]. You still with the mafia?
4	I know, that's why it's a little unfortunate they don't have a test. 
20	Right now I live in a medium sized one but I have lived in a big city for a couple of years.
11	This is nasty NSFW
20	Probably an old dude.
17	Inkling main: I like being cheap. It makes me happy.
15	On being 3x over the speed limit while under the influence, that alone makes him very guilty of something wrong. Thanks for the additional information.
1	Lol I wish
2	I'm just concerned about [NAME] health. Do you think an old, ugly, fat, stupid person like him should be eating such unhealthy meals?
20	They're living their fantasy.
1	I wake up and think I have to go to school and then realize I've graduated and I'm going to work
10	Iirc she's alive but an alcoholic.
4	We have outlets with timers in every parking spot of all households in Finland.
4	This is the reason why I don't have friends. Not even skinny ones, you never know how they will be in the furure
6	Which subcommittee?
20	wtf is 190/140 bp type stuff
20	If you think steamed hams is unexpected anywhere on Reddit, then I got news for you
20	Somebody please make sure Catman doesn‚Äôt freeze to death? Thanks
5	Thanks for clarifying; I've never heard this (it's not a pejorative where I live) so it's good to know.
20	But did [NAME] watch sports bra test videos when he was picking out fernandas ^boobies
3	Dregs of society still the dregs of society shocker.
1	Haha penis.
14	I get all the deja smells and it's terrible.
8	Be great if the DV judge made her refund the cash to every single person, unlikely, but I can fantasize:(
20	Nah dude, it's religious.
2	I have a feeling you're one of those far rightist trump supporters trying to use [NAME]. Your uncaring, almost sociopathic idealogies make me sick.
7	Surprise my what now?
20	I‚Äôve always thought he was overrated until now
20	That's ironic. Because [NAME] isn't getting the Wall funded, we are pulling more resources off the border blockade effort?
2	How is this the epitome of slavery? Nobody is forcing you to do this. Stop being dramatic.
15	Love [NAME]! MAGA and [NAME]! [NAME]! But this is not helping....
1	i love how the caption implies that the only unrealistic thing/ the only thing that gives away the photoshop is the sleeve lol
20	Again, overall, not just for me. 
1	Lol ahh man this made me laugh so hard. That filled my laugh gauge for the day.
16	What a trainwreck
19	Damn....
20	Best sports league in the world.
17	This is amazing. This is how Christmas should be.
9	That is odd.
13	My biggest pet peeve is blown saves.
4	I'm sorry, but this has also caught my attention and I kinda want to see this screenplay.
20	Going by it's [NAME] rating though, the district should be leaning blue. 
20	>It is tailored to your viewing history. That's fairly common knowledge nowadays isn't it? Weird thing for the comic to point out.
9	Ok cheers. I‚Äôm banned from there
13	Totally here for [NAME] and [NAME] boxing [NAME] in before he even announces
22	And the apartment is clean! You can see the floor!
20	Do you agree that voter literacy exams and grandfather clause in post civil war USA were de jure racial-blind but de facto racist?
4	Someone commented that it's like that friend who constantly talks about their ex, but insist they're over them.
8	I‚Äôm just waiting for love
20	Not under [NAME]. Under [NAME] desperate greedy extreme partisan coward politics. They purposely brought racism front and center.
0	[NAME]!! Awesome!! He's the only one that i have anything signed by
7	Can you adopt me? I‚Äôm after those bones
2	Snatched her up with the quickness
20	Matinee games should not be allowed for us anymore, we‚Äôre terrible at matinee games
2	[NAME] is not good enough to get that angry.
20	That's kind of the problem innit? The only solution is for everyone to do something that we all damn well know everyone isn't going to do.
13	Congratulations on securing your CF Future!!!
7	Did you really upload a video you took, of your own cat, to whyweretheyfilming? Seriously?

20	Yeah of the business. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôd word it idk maybe that‚Äôs wrong
1	Then enjoy your shutdown!
10	[NAME] got a bad report card from [NAME] as well today.
0	This is how far the Broncos have fallen. They no longer command the best and the brightest. Now it's .500 retreads. This should be concerning.
0	He has a youtube: Great watch.
9	Emo!!
1	but you won't hear that from most of the press or people on this sub WHAT IS THEIR POLICY THOUGH lmao
4	"""The first step, is to put on a set of vicious stilleto claws. This doesn't make things any easier, but it does build character"""
20	I know plenty of [NAME] that look down on ‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫ Like they‚Äôve forgotten the whole reason Singapore exists
20	Sure you can, but the question is whether or not the kid will listen, or if you will upset the parent. 
10	that was an ugly 5v3
4	Good [NAME], you are right.
20	Or is that a 3:14? You‚Äôre in trouble pal.
20	i got [NAME] a bit of a long shot but i see why
0	Unfamiliar with **[NAME] neighbours** Still I live at least 75' from 2 very nice quiet and respectable peeps.
19	The EU's 'red lines' are in treaty and legislation. The UK's red lines are just May's opinions, they could disappear in two minutes.
5	I bet you're not the only one. That space is kinda safe... go be slightly challenging. ;)
19	I‚Äôve massively improved but it never really gets cured. There are always situations that will give you anxiety.
20	Haven't printed a retraction in twenty years!
20	Yard goats was awesome. Almost a major league feel to it when it‚Äôs a packed day
20	Ah, that's why they say don't run in the corridor
4	"I was just about to comment this. Pause in between ""but"" and ""why"" too"
2	What a complete and utter cunt.
6	I guess that was a compromise with that native sarong that he likes to wear.
14	I hope all my muscles cringe so spastically all my joints come loose and I collapse into a writhing agonized pile of blood and meat.
1	haha. I think he means this in a good way. Just poorly verbalized.
3	But in the end, it doesn‚Äôt even matter
0	I think you have a terrible opinion. Now that we agree on something though this could be the start of a beautiful friendship!
20	Huh, assumed he was more of a grindr fella .....
20	As far as I can tell, but her religion does seem to influence her practice 
15	Thanks a bunch <3
4	Feeling bit better now, but the feeling as a whole will come back I know.
0	[NAME] is super happy. Nice.
3	Yes!!!!!! She‚Äôs a hot mess!
15	Great, thanks :) remember, just let it go!
1	You sound like a creep dude
1	Lol it was a joke. Meta from r/askreddit
17	This is amazing
10	[NAME] is not fascist. Heck,she's not even alt-right
0	I don't know who [NAME] is but you're killin it in that sweater!
0	The design was interesting. But it had a lot of flaws
3	Completely miss-wired! I never thought a kid can grow up miss-wired.
10	Yeah, however you spell it - I don‚Äôt play with them 
23	I can‚Äôt see many players having a problem with [NAME] being gone. Sometimes a coaching change can create the jump start this team needs.
27	I wonder if we will get to actually see the demise of their relationship. I doubt they will do it on the show though.
21	They didn‚Äôt take it; you abandoned it. A TSA agent clarified that for me once. I hope you can replace it easily.
20	They both crazy
6	She looks like a televangelist.
20	"Teacher: ""ok guys, put your phones down (and definitely don't send me the link)"""
9	Didn't mean to offend
2	Which means it isnt his fault? And the 4th? What the fuck was he supposed to do. stop blaming 1 player.
13	Their album is awesome, too.
3	The comments under that video are disturbing. People actually see this as a sign of the end of times.
3	[NAME] is a creeper and hangs out with underage girls n shit.
10	Instagram is the only one to blame for all this evil
20	lol out loud
20	Please tell me she has a partner named [NAME]
20	He'd have to ask his mom
20	This guy doesn‚Äôt like fox hunting because ‚Äútoffs‚Äù do it. As with all policies of the left, it‚Äôs grounded in jealousy. 
5	Try harder next time <3
5	I'm glad you got the help you needed. Sorry we couldn't help you here.
21	Nice try coppers.
4	I think, call before you come and limit it to an hour is reasonable if you have relatives that need to be told that. 
2	WHAT?! You dare insult the band of gods?! Typical teen, I hate my own generation! *screams in 16 year old*
26	Missing this roster üò¢üò¢üò¢
18	I love reading anti gentrification comments. Because they always sound so stupid.
2	You asked if I verified. You set the goal post, not me.
20	Stop the speed. It does that to you
4	I like [NAME], but I'd just rather spend more time with [NAME].
1	This guy's an idiot lol
1	Please keep making them mad
20	Don't worry, it's the internet so that angle has already been well covered: 
12	Also his weird spiked haircut. I wanted spiked hair when I was like 6. I also wanted a mohawk. I'm not 6 anymore.
4	I've long completed everything I can and spent all my fight money. No Kage for me
20	ive had a gedmatch account since 2012, i was just commenting that 23andme hadn't given me any more specific results than it had previously 
10	Yup, not enough money
27	Oh yea [NAME] from Danganronpa 1 is great too, a cute hacker girl and one of my fave charas from the franchise! ‚ú®
2	i hate u...
21	"I didn't know that kind of ""full-tang"" existed. Good to know. "
20	Not that poster, but huh, 
21	Cool. I wish I could come to anarchopulco this year. Have fun.
20	A stunning place, you will need lots of cuddles to stay warm though!
0	Good on your manager for having your back as well
0	Makes me want to break out my 'learn to use my SLR properly' resolution again.. more time commitment tbh. Great shot.
20	the rubber coming off is always a problem
10	You have no recourse. You can always start your own fb group if you'd like.
1	I found [NAME]!! That took me way too long to spot the watermark lol. Good eye!!
15	They don‚Äôt have that on iOS unfortunately üò≠ but thank you for the suggestion!
24	[NAME] can‚Äôt hurt us anymore.
20	I was trying to make a friend that was being a douche jealous by telling him I was having a 3 some. Accidentally messaged it to my father.
20	Oh boy yeah
27	omg what a nightmare, I feel for you üòû is there any way you could order it online?
20	Hit up skull forts if you are looking for the fastest way. But just play and have fun.
20	Shame [NAME] is no longer with us
20	Didn't know they were doing matches on smaller pitch in the combine to see how they do with less reaction time. Thought that was interesting.
20	Personally, I adore capitalism. But that's just me. 
2	The Netflix documentary about [NAME] absolutely sucks. Don't waste your time.
1	When asked about my hopes for the Wild, i always (half) jokingly say, ‚Äúi hope my grandkids can see them raise their first Cup‚Äù
15	Another thank you, this is great info.
20	Probably end of February and all of March before release. I think that's what they did last year
4	Congrats keep going
21	Too many injuries. I predict he will be off the roster by September.
9	Yeah that is a pretty crap and unhelpful thing to say, especially coming from someone who works in that job. 
10	No I didn‚Äôt think that, it was the way the information was presented
1	I enjoy shouting this at my husband and our friends when they're being especially nerdy.
18	"I absolutely love that idea ""BuT a CoP tOlD mE"""
20	Uh eat less than you burn per day. Eat a lot of protein.
20	You got a friend in meeeee...
0	Interesting what you said about the crew and better to fly solo than with people who bring you down. I'll remember that.
20	I like where you‚Äôre going with this....
20	Lol, and be sure to slam the door real hard when you leave.
2	Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.
12	"It makes for awkward conversation when I ask ""What's your favorite song?"" And I get ""I just liked the shirt"" in response"
20	Damn right.
20	I bet she smells like a jar of mayo left open for a week in the summer
5	Keep on hmmm-ing toots. Maybe you‚Äôll put yourself to sleep
7	Cheers, brother. What are you doing to meet women? 
20	Human life has value. Veganism and pro-life are 2 completely different ballparks morally. Terrible argument 1/10
20	Idk I felt like that until I got diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease.
20	You can be highly educated and still incredibly ignorant.
7	>They split up 5 years later after an extremely messy situation with Dr [NAME]. Very very long story. I would like to hear this story
22	Don‚Äôt worry I gave him silver
10	‚ÄúThe weird thing is she‚Äôs got a tattoo of our company on her back...‚Äù lmfao
4	Prey actually had portals before Portal. Such an underrated game.
15	Thanks for contributing to the point I just made. More complaining and self-assuring. Yap away.

7	Didn‚Äôt they play a game earlier this season with both [NAME] and [NAME] out?
15	Thank you for your help my friend
4	I will admit,I did chuckle a bit

9	Both. I have a feeling that broth was ruined a long time ago, in a footballers bedroom not so far away.
4	I‚Äôll agree with you on that, I think it would fit well on someone‚Äôs forearm! 
1	That is great insight. Once mom is against you, you‚Äôre done.

3	I wish I could help you but I‚Äôm in the same ditch as you. High school is causing me troubles too

20	Indian : Malai kofta at Bombay house Also Balaji Caffe in West Jordan for some authentic South Indian fare
5	Him being in prison (if these useless people and their story is real) HIV and Hep C should be a concern for her.
22	Wah, the poor dead fascist thug! What a fucking tragedy. Every dead cop makes the world a safer place.

15	Thanks all. It was a league game in our local bar. The dealer rotates on each hand. Lesson learned from me.
6	Even after reading all your posts, I still don't understand... üòë
7	wow, you guys have a body language now?
20	They do. Also ‚Äòschool spirit‚Äô is never an acceptable excuse for **PUTTING ON BLACKFACE**
25	Heart breaking* sorry haha
15	Done. Thanks!
6	Disinfected or sanitized maybe. No way an entire exam table is sterilized.
18	Love you (No homo)
20	SHAVE YOUR BEAR
9	I really get that, it's soooo disappointing. I hope he can make it up to you.

17	It‚Äôs my birthday too! I‚Äôve always love it!
20	I've just thrown all my spoons in the bin. I'll learn to eat yoghurt with a fork.
3	‚ÄúReal men‚Äù. [NAME] be more offensive.
13	I'm glad you have your kids, but have you seen Brooklyn 99 like the op stated? It's worth living for too.
10	that is not true. I often shoot the rifle round the blast 2 shots from the double barrel. Unless it got changed recently.
20	The problem is that when [NAME] comes back were going to have 9 defensemen and the only one you can send down is [NAME].
7	How could they forget the gravy?
2	I for one am with you on this train. I loved [NAME] man but this sub is losing its damn mind lol
0	I didn't even know there were two types of strep. That's very interesting!
20	Can you skip second book without damaging the whole series?
17	I adore this. It gave me so many chills of happiness!
1	LOL that would be way better
18	I love your username
3	I already told you, food poisoning or allergic foods. The real greedy snake oil salesmen are big pharma.
20	Are you poly, or just poly for him?
5	May your test be negative and your New Year's be happy!
6	Was that really the best option in KC? Those games looked super empty even with 20k in that stadium.
11	Context doesn‚Äôt exactly make state murder of the ‚Äústupid poor‚Äù better.

20	The fact that you stayed this long really doesn‚Äôt but the blame on him, you chose this relationship 
15	Thank you for the support! Hope to see you in the chat!
9	It is pretty disappointing when you can't pet a service dog that's cute but the rule has to be followed.
0	I like the fact that you like it a lot.
1	I read that whole thing, so damn funny. But seriously, all those guys need to be sterilized.

0	Fantastic, good for [NAME] white. Poor [NAME].
3	I crave nuts and nut butter all üëè the üëè damn üëè time. I think my body know they‚Äôre calorie and nutrient dense üòÇ
2	If this was some weird publicity stunt to announce the [NAME] is coming back I will die. In reality, it makes me think he's coming back
7	Is this a mood?
1	Actually [NAME] had the #1 PP who bazooka [NAME] fired lol
18	I love when they send in the wrong meat, it‚Äôs only happened to me once,
20	Rather than having to guess at which part you consider a strawman, maybe you could just quote it for me. I may not always recognise fallacies.
23	I know it's easy for me to say because it wasn't me but money is money. We can always make more. Really sorry dude.
7	Nice try coppers.
3	Ignorance is unfortunately a part of mankind. We are still so Un-evolved
9	The west is so unfair :(
20	Can you imagine the [NAME] brothers getting pitched by a woman who believes in chemtrails
5	You seem pretty upset about this. It's not an email it is a formal filing. It doesn't surprise me you don't understand that though.
26	I thought chiropractors were bad! Look as these medical doctors who were pushing opiates on their patients by the thousands!
26	I wish I could forget. Stop reminding me :(
15	Thank you [NAME]. Best of luck. I'll always remember your goal to clinch MLS Cup 2017.
4	I‚Äôve made snapchats like this for friends
2	You crush them up
21	I like that she thinks the water will save her.
3	Something's wrong. The top post on r/conspiracy isn't completely anti-conspiracy? Wow, feels weird. /s(?)
4	Oh definitely. When you work for the gov't you root for the party looking to expand it. Maybe that's how you'll get a raise right?
4	Cool. Glad I'm not the only one who found it weird.
9	Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.
1	I think [NAME] did such a classy exit! Hopefully people don‚Äôt give her too much hate. She comes from a good place.
6	I never will understand the reasoning behind puking in a toilet... Perfectly good bucket right there.
3	I'd imagine they're mostly fakes. You'd be uncomfortably warm in a real CG Parka in our climate.

4	I believe we are playing them in June and November in the Euro qualifiers
0	You sound like you're going to be a great PA! Good luck in your new career.
0	[NAME] had a great idea about this problem actually

13	Hell yeah! Make sure you get your tickets in advance because we are getting very close to selling out!
15	I didn't realise this was happening! Thank you! It was hard to tell from OPs photo what the changes were
15	What a sweetheart.
21	Well Happy Birthday from another random stranger on the internet. I spent my birthday mostly alone too, hope your day wasn‚Äôt too bad. üíô
20	That‚Äôs not true at all. I play on xbox and you can‚Äôt Loot teammates you or any squad mates kill.
4	Yeah I could not even do that I could not move my leg to the side
10	If we can‚Äôt even score on the power play pulling the goalie made no sense
9	[NAME] gave me depression because had I been left unchecked I would have bested him in hand to hand combat by age 16
9	Women always seem to write that though, plus emotipns and emojis. When a man writes likr that it comes off odd ajd feminine in a bad way.
0	[NAME] is a gem and I love him but he should really be a DH somewhere
1	Same thing I thought haha
20	Welcome to New York.

10	nah. YOU will get it when you're about 20 years older.
4	Yeah so I got kicked from a group chat for gnoming people*
20	This show would suck without him. It would just be the same old [NAME] bullies someone bs it usually is
15	You dont know how much that boosted my self-esteem right now. Thank you stranger
2	She wasn't fucking running, no matter how hard you insist. You'd make a wonderful Qld cop with that mentality.
27	Looks weirdly fake Edit: turns out it‚Äôs real

1	They‚Äôre words and they‚Äôre hilarious
23	That's ironic.
0	Makes us wonder what its going to be like for my children's generation..
17	If you bought it from Levi‚Äôs I think they do it for free at their flagship store
10	Chicken and the egg argument. Gun companies don't donate to [NAME] *because* they have gun control on their platform. This goes back decades mind you.
13	Yeah I know, it‚Äôs just wishful thinking but I would be ecstatic if it came out today
3	I have adhd whats so bad about it?
0	This is much better! Good mods [T]/
20	Those guys are on top 5 Levels.
3	..... That would seem like the ultimate way to get rejected and never spoken to again.
10	What? The non-vegan burger air particles have clearly infiltrated the once-pure cardboard. It is absolutely NOT vegan >:(

1	I think that had to do more with not wanting to hurt the old man lol
6	[NAME] has been injured for a while... No point in doing that comparison. Not sure if a troll or just new to football
4	The economy is heavily controlled and subsidized by the government. In any case, I was poking at the lack of nuance in US politics today
26	I'm nauseous
5	Be honest with her... or put her on a pedestal just high enough to see up her dress... ;)
20	Oh bb please tell me about possible sanctions
1	Nobody wants to fight the naked guy.
4	Yes that is so true why didn‚Äôt I think of that
10	Oh sh*t guys I got banned
9	That sex doesn't exist and we're all just pretending for his benefit...
4	You're free to believe all of that, but we're going to have to wait and see how it actually all plays out.
2	No, I don't mind all that much. I just hate being subjected to second hand carcinogens
11	And the woman dropped her underwear and begged him to fuck her. But in all his MGTOWness he refused.
20	Sweet sweet air con. Apparently it‚Äôs going to be a hot one today.
9	Your comment from exactly 40 days ago was, ‚ÄúYour mom.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt recommend you eat your words. 
18	[NAME] was the only one I actually liked, besides [NAME].
5	But we're just trying to diffuse the tension and teach them about peace!
7	If [NAME] hands the presidency to [NAME] do you really think the public will be more accepting of independent candidates?
7	"I'm curious about ""STERN? guy"" from the Phantom Menace review. I've never seen him in anything since."
20	Another pathetic PP.

2	all the more reason to not give a fuck about CFF
0	It's just a sexy hamburgler cosplay
20	[NAME]. And I‚Äôm not even trolling. I seriously love him.
17	I really enjoy my job but I get paid $62k I don't know if that's considered high paying but it's plenty for me.
20	I'm a cis woman and your wardrobe sounds like like my ideal fall wardrobe!
10	It's weird that actual socialists will say that politics has moved far to the right.
2	You get closure by blocking her on your phone and all social media. She dumped you. It's over.
4	They are very heavily scripted which is why it can be borderline unethical.
2	Welcome to racial integration, where your civility standards are racist and you better shut up or else.
1	She got me into it so not wrong lol
13	Except trophy hunters, although take away their gun and see how well they fare then.
20	You could try addressing the post you're replying to.
16	Not a different issue especially when the majority of the people affected by these deaths are lower income
20	Oh dayum. Didn't notice that the first time I looked at it. Yikes for OP.
18	>Gotta love the South No. No, you really don‚Äôt.

15	I want the same drug OP is into thanks!

0	we need more [NAME] like [NAME] and [NAME]. So far those are the only 2 who I have seen stick to their principles.

2	Fake lous!
20	Minimalist aesthetic stuff that doesn‚Äôt look goofy.
20	Because it's incredibly cringy.
20	And it‚Äôs being posted by a person who apparently has an MD, PhD, and MBA. One would hope they knew better
23	There was a fuel station near mine where they put the fuel in the wrong underground tanks. So you can at least unload it wrong.
24	Okay cool. Gonna drive home from the hospital.
20	They were bad times.
2	you are trying to use post-modern mumbo jumbo deconstruction of words. Go away, idiot.
4	Yep, you can go around crashing into things and run people over and completely get away with it. 
17	This made me chuckle. I hope it is raptors v warriors in the finals. That‚Äôs gonna be a fun series to watch.
11	I read it as him taking her virginity. Raping her...unless it was consensual and she WANTED to lose it.
20	I mean it‚Äôs definitely rushed but your clock is ticking and could be possibly on the verge of running out. I say go for it.
13	And a happy holiday to you.
23	I test ENFP and I relate to this thread so much.
20	>!I mean he did give himself a weird new arm...!<
4	The most siamese cat thing ive ever seen- weird, sexy, playful, smart, deadly. 
9	>putz Is he [NAME]? I would've not voted for him if I knew that.
3	I‚Äôve just said that both biology and social norms play a part? How is that me saying that there are no biological differences?
20	Feb ‚Äò06 [NAME] But your point stands
20	The caption is kinda stupid, but I like the photo.
10	And yet still just outside of the playoffs and not the worst team in the last 10 games.
20	The weight of all that water is enough to kill someone if they don‚Äôt drown.
20	Struck a nerve I see. Press X to doubt
20	Holy shit!!! üòÆ That‚Äôs friggin beautiful
20	Until it gets to a point where you are a stalker.
0	That must smell so good. Oh i want some now.
4	Except people have been yelling about climate change for decades, it‚Äôs just that finally a prominent politician has made it their main point.
20	I wish this was me.. To have lots of friends.. *Sad dragon noises*
0	[NAME] has an amazing track record. I think some people forget how innovative and unpredictable the [NAME] era offense was.
0	We're playing great!
2	I disagree with you, therefore you must be an idiot. K.
10	No if we tell and kick and scream and have a tantrum that always works.
20	I was picturing [NAME]
19	They could have used the explanation of E-2 people vibrating at a different frequency. At least that‚Äôs previously established.
0	Well being very close to the border, I know lots of [NAME] and your guys' hugs are always warm!
20	Don't play dumb, there are political parties that promote liberalism and conservatism as their main philosophies.
20	Don't remember the gold but I wanna say like $16ish and like 430 exp
20	Same company probably makes bacon for Walmart and Kroger. Im guessing they're not the only ones

27	[NAME] was almost all around higher rated going into the draft Hindsight is 20/20
1	And then they say, ‚ÄúHAHAHAHHA IT WAS RIGHT THERE WOW!‚Äù
20	If too many medical professionals die then life will be worse as we cannot get medical treatment
20	Not really. My group of friends are awesome in every way possible except they are homophobic
21	Hope [NAME] is watching this but he's probably too busy snorting some lines
4	Best part about this is that the cowboys will re-sign [NAME] and hopefully [NAME] too
10	Local Area Man Finally Finds Area Woman Willing To Let Him Sniff Her Hair

20	I bloody hate L3-37's name. it's literally L337. How much stupider can a droid name get.

20	I hope [NAME] bullies wittle baby [NAME] tonight, like he did last year!
15	Thank you, you are blessed
20	US is of the top oil exporters in the world. 2003 wants it‚Äôs talking point back.

0	I've been in China for years. I love it. Great job, apartment and love my city. I've never had a single problem 
20	More fake news from CNN. I thought coming off the last fake news blowup they would at least bother to watch the video before writing their ridiculous story.
20	Interest rates seem crazy low. It doesn't seem worth it to lend anything except DAI.
3	It tasted strange to me.
17	Players like this makes me rage quit tbh.

6	Is that bottom trey filled with beer? If so, how did he acquire them?

0	Absolutely insane documentary. I actually thought it was a parody at one point but it‚Äôs all real.
4	My point is that since they should both get the same sentence...it doesn't matter who is who. Push them both in...

3	Thank [NAME] though! Imagine someone like that with kids... yikes
20	You know what‚Äôs a real tragedy? I‚Äôm yet to find Soleil art with brand.

1	lool ok I laughed pretty hard at this.
9	Considering how much they project and accuse how often they others of only hating X person because of their race, it makes sense.
20	Aye me, it's shite and the folk who follow it all think there cool, bore off

15	Ah well, that'll do it. Thanks for the clarification. Should have been obvious really...
20	In the first combo if you just do the b+k instead of even bothering to kick it does 1 more damage Not much obviously but yeah just a thought

20	[NAME] having an adult life, yeah ist tiring. But not exactly new and not at all women specific imo.
20	It is odd you are singling me out rather than those who identify with those terms and use them endlessly and with insults.
2	The emojis in the background. Wtf lmao
15	We both will be having a read at these links, thank you! 
4	Yes that is so true why didn‚Äôt I think of that
14	This kills the country.
27	After [NAME] comment the stock prices fell and the [NAME] was never heard from again. Crab juice went up 4 points
27	Lost finger how?
0	[NAME] runs a zone coverage base. [NAME] is much better in zone than [NAME] or [NAME]. However, the other 2 are better in isolation.
7	Did you see on ig where HER MAN offered a fake [NAME] profile use of his pj üòÇüòÇ
20	*various incoherent screaming*

26	That sounds so terrible. I'm very sorry.
3	I carry on an empty. But I also carry a single action. So don't make my mistakes.
23	Cows should only be milked by their calves. That‚Äôs kind of the reason why cows produce milk.
7	That‚Äôs always what I thought as well, but isn‚Äôt that essentially being transphobic, etc? 
10	i say no or in da club if they come to damce with me i walk away
27	Now I'm wondering if [NAME] drinks, and if he's ever been inebriated during one of his deals.
15	That‚Äôs good to know- thank you!
4	I like this
14	Worrying what other people think is what collectivists have brainwashed you to think and feel. You are just a coward making excuses for your cowardice.
17	I'm slightly ashamed to say I thought that was what the title implied too. Glad that's not the case
6	Either they don‚Äôt understand the meta context of it, or aren‚Äôt fans of such a meta ending.
20	You cannot open or keep it. You can send it RTS.
26	I'm so sad.
20	My point is that we should fight the whole system, not a single hospital that does the best they can. 
20	Just buy a load of old iPhone back covers in China.

20	LPT for controversial thing use bing. They dont filter as muchas google.
2	Ah man, I‚Äôve downvoted it now. OP you suck
2	If you had to think of a way to survive this how the hell would you. Damn
20	I can‚Äôt wait for this Narrative to stop. DLO has the best numbers just look.
10	Oh I know. [RELIGION] is the most severe form of brainwashing on the planet. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing like it. It blows my mind.
20	I kinda thought that's what you had meant. I'm a simple man.
17	That was fun.
20	You're not really pissing anyone off. Mostly we just pity you.
20	Both Islanders goaltenders support [NAME] and they are having career years, coincidence? I think not. 
15	We get it, you take Etizolam, congrats I guess..üëè 
6	You are uninformed. Its not just because of the wall.
20	that‚Äôs just because they haven‚Äôt started the knitting circle yet. that‚Äôs when it gets reeaaaal crazy!
1	A TECHNICAL Lmao.
20	These moments happen. Even if he was hella cold when he got home, you dont threaten a man. He may be stubborn enough to call your bluff 
20	But do you have a notoriously shady history a la Jax? (Hope not)
3	I want to call bs on this after smelling my boyfriend's. Have to leave the room whenever he lets one out...
4	I completely agree, I just think there is more of a chance of Clowney getting tagged than [NAME] getting tagged a second time.
26	Ned Stark: Dead Stark
20	This happens all too much. The game cannot keep up with so many actions especially if ur ping is bad
23	I would of gone to the doctor way before that

2	I recommend this. I read the WN and it fucked up my English for months. English is my second language...
4	I‚Äôve never heard him say it but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he did. It‚Äôs believable enough
18	As much as I like [NAME] and want him to score so many (hes a speedy mofo) I think that this would be a good trade for sure
21	Please! She‚Äôs my #1 choice. The rare mix of super likeable and hypercompetent. Like [NAME] mixed with [NAME].
23	This post is inappropriate for this subreddit.
1	This guy is a hack lmao

13	Too sore to make dinner tonight. Wong's Kitchen it is!

4	I think that's more a matter of character's personalities, I think, more than development. But for the rest, I agree. 
20	They made this exact post like a month ago, 
3	Then tell me what he's doing, instead of being a racist hypocrite.
15	Thank you for responding with truth to a top comment that is intentionally very misleading
15	"It's called ""internalised misogyny"" and feminists are aware of it and discussing it. Thanks for your concern though."

14	Even today, many years later that still gives me chills. RIP.
20	That's not how tl;dr's work

20	If this is a medical situation the analogy still applies üôÑ
13	That‚Äôs so drastic. Just hide it by parting your hair on the other side for 2 weeks till the gap‚Äôs not so visible.
17	I will take 10 more years of overpowered Tracer before I enjoy having Brig as a counter
7	That's really interesting. How come?
21	Kinda looks like Ballymun too. Or some council flats from a London ghetto.
0	I love Subnautica. It's so, so terrifying but also beautiful and cool and I can wimp out and put it down any time. 
23	Look at a calendar. Look at the 14th. Look at the week that contains the 14th. That week, any of the days on that week. 
8	I feel like [NAME] and [NAME] from AH should chat, especially about the [NAME] from BOTW
2	That's freedom of speech for you. We have to give even the assholes a chance to talk, because the alternatives are worse.
17	And happy cake day.
21	The weapon wasn‚Äôt made until 1918-1919 so hopefully this will never be real
4	An extreme strawman example doesn't change what I said.
4	I agreed with your comment until you told people they shouldn‚Äôt be parents for not knowing the difference between deodorant and antiperspirant.
20	I don't know what they say about fools and their money, but I'll gladly pay you to find out

4	Someone got carried away with the mii maker

15	Thank you sis!
0	[NAME] ‚ÄúGood! It‚Äôs such a distraction to the team!‚Äù
20	And riding one makes you look like a man trying to be tough during his mid life crisis.
22	That‚Äôs dope nice job
4	I do take Vitamin C, daily. I purchased some probiotics yesterday. Hope those will help. 
20	There‚Äôs no PR firm in the world that could change her image, especially when she keeps creating fake accounts and being mean to people. 
3	That gives me flashbacks to when my mom used to record me crying because she thought it was funny. Ugh.
2	2. I hate to say it but it‚Äôs the same thing I do and I hate myself for it
11	Combination of lapses in defense and the continuing saga of the Sabres' god awful PP.
26	The only death that made me feel any emotion. And it wasn‚Äôt even the death itself.
19	I already called the county I got married in trying to find out about it but they had nothing on either of us about a divorce.. Im so anxious.
20	I'll bite. What's your story?

13	That was amazing!
7	[NAME] explains why she was so close to her grandmother.
10	My mums been with her second husband 30 odd years now. Second marriages can work but you definitely have to fix and heal yourself first.
20	Bore off, you pearl-clutching, centerist coward. 
18	I love that username
5	Keep your head straight, stay on your path, and stick to your guns. 
1	Lol.... i guess your personal experience explains everything.... personally I've seen this play out numerous times in the work place..... so.....
15	The good news is you‚Äôre catching the possibility of it early. And medicine has come a long way! Giving you lots of good energy
20	>Even though [NAME] quit live performing after he got diagnosed but ok
10	That does not look appetizing
12	My bad. Was half asleep while typing and couldn‚Äôt remember how to spellüòÇ I just let autocorrect take over, thanks! Lol
3	Just thinking about all the stupid stuff I did as a kid makes me very afraid for my 5 year old.
2	I don‚Äôt care what anyone says. Party pizzas are the best frozen pizza you can get. Still mad about them being square now, though.
15	Thanks for the reply. You're right though. If you make a scene about it, you might as well be tattling. Go Browns
6	I don't think this makes much sense for Sacramento.
7	was the dad just seeing things when he smacked [NAME] hand away?
15	Thanks, I hate constant reposts.
3	I hope your brother is okay. Don‚Äôt listen to this guy, he‚Äôs a cunt.
23	Obviously there is a unicorn conspiracy perpetuated by [NAME], who are trying to suppress the truth about one-horned animals 
23	Never had a girl out right tell me she likes me and i have been in 3 somewhat long relantionships.
3	Annoyed by the people refusing**
20	Ahhh. A civil and interesting conversation on the internet. How refreshing.
20	It's like [NAME] said, man. You look for the guy that benefits, and uh... You know, uh...

15	[NAME] sure saved that one from swirling down the toilet. Thank you [NAME].
15	Cool. Thanks for the tips!

20	After 3 sacks today, ‚ÄúAre you not entertained?‚Äù -[NAME] probably 
27	This is the most upbeat and pleasant I've ever seen someone whose been caught with multiple ounces of weed and ecstasy.
20	As I said, the justification needs to be found outside of a separate measure of support.
20	damn that kid can jump
15	Thanks. That's a handy resource. My question remains unanswered.
10	This should be the norm instead of the exception. Sadly the leaders in law enforcement are almost always more into politics than principles.
12	My t levels are normal. Doctor thinks its my low carb diet but I dont buy that
17	[NAME] playing for the heat always makes me laugh
3	All I want for Christmas is a broken home
10	I wouldn‚Äôt worry, most United fans have never even been to Manchester. 
13	sweet home alabama
7	Correct. The LTB judgements are enforced by going through small claims. Which makes for another hurdle for tenants trying to collect judgements.
20	I literally just finished watching the second episode of Daredevil. This pains me
4	Valid. That shit right there is valid as hell.
11	oh [NAME] this is horrible
1	This one is by [NAME]! Your suggestion was funny to me, and you've been blessed with your joke being DR Onion #20!
7	Are you implying that pundits rightly criticising shite refereeing is responsible for folk threatening [NAME]?
0	so proud of you!
3	"Holy shit. I remember sleeping on the back window ""ledge"" in my parents' car! I haven't thought about that in years."
1	This guy died on the inside lol
20	ROLL THE DICE
9	Omg I'm crying and shaking rn [NAME] would never say that
7	Looks like you don't have a story too.
20	The first guy had his balls covered, he knew.
4	I unironically approve of this message. It is time for the French Revolution to end.
0	The prevailing thought is he'll be too expensive to resign. I love him as a piece on the team but he's a deal sweetener.
20	Nobody is forced to use pronouns by law as he's claimed, it's a blatant lie he made up to further his agenda. 
0	Awesome, great to see people coming together for peer to peer cash!
7	I didn't realize being in my late 20s qualified me as a senior citizen, where do I get my AARP card?
13	Omg it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre taking the words from my mind.
7	Have you talked to him about it and made it clear he understands where you are coming from?
3	> shoddy hitboxes, imprecise movement Compared to what 3D game exactly? Have you not played Dark Souls?
7	What's the source? I love this.
7	Why should I get flayed? He's the one who sucks!
5	I grew up there!! Moved away 20 years ago but still my home. Hope you're having fun .
20	Little did you know 95% of these kids just don‚Äôt want to go to school
20	Human faces are remarkably elastic, aren‚Äôt they?
4	You are right. There's absolutely no group of liberals here that calls everyone right of [NAME] [NAME] every chance they get.
20	He is in [NAME] team. He bend a knee and give up the North because fall in love with her. As script said.
4	I think that making someone an approved submitter might get around that. Not 100% sure though.
9	That would be an unfamiliar feeling
10	You conveniently aren't speaking to my assertion.
8	I wish I could get the entire interview but it's from a SiriusXM Radio Show
7	Were these the platforms they ran on.
20	I seen a video, must have been one of the students where they've completely surrounded the [NAME]. 
20	Brother, we've been separated.
13	Happy cake day to him
8	I really wish this wonderful person would run for president! <3
20	I don't remember accurately but something in the lines of >and slightly leaning back so as to not be able to reach the remote
20	Wait a second what? The asshat found the story? Can someone teach me how to use the way back machine so i can read this?
13	Almost in tears watching him celebrate, true captain ‚ù§Ô∏è
3	Reading that made my stomach feel how it does when I get the wind knocked out of me.
23	She looks like that in every photo
1	she does look like a hooker though lol
20	okay but i need a strategy on how to deal with this
20	Ugh [NAME] is like when your ex-girlfriend suddenly gets really hot. I can't even look at him.
3	> I dont understand why team record matters so much. The entire purpose of playing is to win games.
0	Did you guys personally pay someone for the banner? Because that's incredible.
18	I love it
1	Your comment reminds me of that one satirical GTA V radio ad where the advertiser tries to encourage people to beat their kids. It's kinda funny.
7	Do you think each worker looks after only one child?
4	I actually find it easier to place spawn beacons in stupid spots like this than a nice flat empty piece of ground.
0	Take a upvote I'm glad I made your experience great
20	But if we go to the FCS right now, and never play y'all at the cotton bowl again, we keep the hat.
9	already exposed when h2k went 2-16. Sure they didn't have the best players, but going 2-16 means the coaching staff should also shoulder the blame.
5	Dude, take back your life and dignity. GTFO!!!
0	There kinda funny
20	Then stop arresting them for shooting at thieves
4	Some people just need a hug
13	Wowowowow!!!! I‚Äôve been campaigning for [NAME] too!
20	It‚Äôs not really a surprise that sick people consume more healthcare resources than people who aren‚Äôt sick, is it?
6	A successful centralized ratings company?
3	honestly i don‚Äôt think logan paul meant anything except to sound woke so he could get attention
20	We‚Äôre some spoiled [NAME].
20	I think it has more to do with them deriving a sense of identity from work. Remove the work and what remains?
0	They then went to a piano concert together. This conflict is amazing in it's twists and turns.
20	The secret is you have to ice them for ten minutes.
14	Any one of us could be a journalist, and that level of journalism feeding the masses is mildly scary.
2	What are you apologizing for? Vent bro, that‚Äôs why we are here
10	Didn't expect him to land back in the championship, although mears was much more unlikely
20	Never surrender mate
10	I thought it may be the industry, but based on other people‚Äôs answers here, I‚Äôm not so sure :/ 
10	Definitely not Mom‚Äôs favorite.
4	good lookin out bro
20	From super smash bros melee?
15	plz pm the telegram group thanks
6	We had 2 1000 yrd receivers, why would we add a 3rd?
20	I mean it certainly is a ritual so to speak.
15	We will welcome you with open arms <3
2	Wow that is one part disgusting and another part a huge waste of time for expecting an entertaining payoff. Warning, this video also includes spoilers for the latest Avengers.
15	Kudos to OP for not falling for the bait.
20	We absolutely can't leave the first three rounds without an offensive tackle. Preferably Round 1 or 2
20	Probably an old dude.
13	New flavour! I love it!
7	Except that he's doing it because there's an election quickly approaching.
20	Didn't he say [NAME] should cave and give [NAME] his wall money?
23	He got his drawers blowed off
20	They were saying the other guy who revelead this was lying! I knew it was true. Mods are gonna delete this post dude they are censoring.
20	He's rooting for the losing team and is pissed.
18	I love you
23	HUGE difference! SO important! Amen sister.
9	I hope you can get some relief soon, I can‚Äôt imagine how awful that must feel 
20	He wasn't being a jerk he was playing .they are friends you can tell by the way they interacted
20	Damn Blake is on fire today
9	You win the poverty Olympics.
20	This is what I assumed, but I haven't seen any confirmation of this anywhere.
20	His plan would have worked if [NAME] was not teleported by the writters for that dramatic (And nonsensical) part of the episode.
19	The ‚Äúfiguring it out‚Äù part seems really hard
0	I'll show some love for diazepam! Congratulations on the re up and let me Know if they are
21	I hope your relationships are no longer abusive either physically or emotionally.
1	you‚Äôre too lazy to google
20	Or he could just not share your beliefs? I mean, you don‚Äôt think his ethnicity should dictate his political views, do you?
11	But that makes even less sense. The government is having a hard time collecting taxes, therefore people are poor? 
4	Gl hf team we can do this! :[NAME]: Whole team leaves
0	My favorite calm BGs are [NAME] and [NAME] :)
20	He was playing with absolute garbage teammates, and the one year he was on a decent team he had 44 points in 48 games. 
2	[NAME] just wants to post pics of her facetuned of herself for attention while acting morally superior to those other girls. fuck off
23	Sounds like you know the answer, and at first she will resent you. But hopefully over time will realize what your doing. 
7	I just realized people in apartments are essentially screwed, that is too bad man, hopefully you'll get that going soon! It's worth it!
9	When you're accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression.
14	I don't know how accurate that is, pure nicotine is a lot different to nicotine in tobacco so I doubt vaping is that addictive
20	I wouldn't want to take any of his medals away but lets also not act like he was instrumental in either.
20	This is about as unacceptable as the subject can get.
13	no its amazing.
15	Super helpful. Thanks!
18	Let's get petty! Love it
8	Maybe one day but I am very cultured*
20	I see this as a guy making fun of a small sect of women, not a bitter jab at all as a whole
11	Seriously? That‚Äôs so frustrating. It was [NAME] time to go, some of these ‚Äúfans‚Äù are disgusting.
4	Okay, you accidentally injured someone. Good luck in court buddy
10	No. Not the I. :(
2	She should be FIRED
16	Because Im going to feel sorry for the death of someone who assaulted me. Sure thing buddy.
4	Saw a video on Instagram from my friend that lives in Longmont. The snow looks so pretty. Do want.
15	Good to know the obsessive thinking is because of them... I‚Äôve felt like it was just me ha. Thank you üôè
1	I for one am with you on this train. I loved [NAME] man but this sub is losing its damn mind lol
20	Dan cool and rich
20	The twist is that is that it was all a [NAME] fever dream the whole time.
0	[NAME] has so many people shook.
20	....it‚Äôs just raining on my face
0	One time, she punched me in the face. It was AWESOME.
20	League wants an LA team to finally work so bad
20	Humm, just a few days after I unsubbed. You aren't luring me back again though r/Murderedbywords !
10	I did something along those lines almost 2 years ago and got to 67 upvotes before I got banned
21	imagine if this was [NAME] people would lose their shit
23	it's the result of a structural problem inherent in all forms of vanguardism, though. it's not the result of MLs being fascists or not leftists
7	>but part of the whole inequality picture is women receiving lower pay for the same jobs. Honestly? Doesn't happen.
20	It most definitely is! You‚Äôve gotta pick some up!!
10	The master will not be pleased.
20	Man that was a long of run on sentences but whatever.
15	Ah, well thank you. On an unrelated note, does ‚ÄúBenchys‚Äù mean boobs?
23	She was sorry too, after I found out and ripped her a new one. LOL
20	Came here to say exactly this. It's almost the same scene, as if he tried to recreate it
10	Probably. The fact his reaction to you being injured was to go off and have sex with a stranger is not a healthy sign.
9	Came here looking for the knowitall that explains the difference. Disapointed in reddit today.
20	I wasn‚Äôt talking about them buddy...
26	RIP manning lol
23	Oh. You‚Äôre one of.... ^*those.*
21	Looks expensive. Hope you enjoyed the game!
20	I told [NAME] not to shoot [NAME] cause I didn‚Äôt think [NAME]‚Äô dumbass would turn his back right in front of her.
20	r/LazyMan. 1080p 60fps.
20	I said none of those things. My awareness of a slang term and its means is just that. Understanding language.
20	It will only get worse over time. Do what I didn‚Äôt. Run.
20	I'd say no, mostly because you don't plan to stay long-term.
5	There's a Houston Jobs subreddit that may be of some help!
24	This is a serious question. Are you glad they told you?
20	That dog did not want saved at all.
7	A bag of pita chips is really $8?
8	Get him back -- as in figure out what went wrong and see what you can do
4	Bad sarcasm in response to a bad joke seems about right to be fair.
20	you can‚Äôt duel yourself you walnut
3	If that‚Äôs the case then these shows really are all about messing up people‚Äôs health...
7	Show me that hog daddy
20	Its hard to look at. Its just gross.
20	> for solo players Play. Mercenary. Playlist. :)
20	[NAME] ONLY WANTS STUPID VERONICAS AND STACIES AND NOT US, GAYS RISE UP
20	Mmmm squeeze dat cheek
20	Interesting my bodies blurry but I wanna dtW that
26	i ended up crying and breaking down once i got to my friends house, i'm so sorry that happened to you as well :~( 
17	I'm so glad [NAME] finally got her visa, she's going to do awesome living in the USA!!!!
8	Thank you .. I wish I was religious.. I admire religion... My mind just doesn't want to believe..
20	I'd watch out for the brother. He seems like the type of guy to try to murder you years from now.
2	Don‚Äôt tell me what to do.
20	It's not really controversial any year, but he's commentating a game with [NAME] in it. He has the counterpoint right in front of him.
4	At this point all you can do is put full faith in the man. Let him get creative
0	Yeah, I was thinking they would be super cute with black heels and a snug black crop top.
16	I tell them my wife died in a car accident 10 years ago and I couldn‚Äôt fall in love again. I‚Äôve never been married.
17	I think everyone would enjoy it more if you did
1	asking for a source is good lol
18	I would love both of them
1	Don't, it's shit compared to the original. It's rather WATERed down :P Jokes aside it isn't as good.
26	sad that the Euphoric tipbot is no more
6	Does she hate the men in her family too? O.O
18	Gotta love jetpacking.
7	Wait a minute, the rich own ranches.... You're one of them!
3	Just shut up dude
20	Don‚Äôt link the technical definition of terms if you don‚Äôt want people to apply it. Enjoy your New Year.
20	Yes. Many wedding parties don't know what to do with the ring bear after the vows, so there are many up for adoption.
20	You'd think, but people are given a lot of leeway. Hell, in the South, public schools are allowed to spank children.
0	[NAME]. growing some ladyburn1974 as part of my first grow. thank you!
2	Holy fuck [NAME]!
1	I guess some people just hate fun, lol
20	Same.. that was brutal
4	Dude you‚Äôre right but just because we draft someone in the 1st round doesn‚Äôt guarantee a starting caliber QB.
1	Lmao you fart bigger to cover up the first one
1	I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Either way. Lol
3	Holy shit that‚Äôs nothing
15	Eh, that can happen anywhere. It isn't exclusive to Dallas where that stuff happens. Good luck tho.
5	His whole point is that he doesn't have to give a damn about others or how they feel.
20	The people I went to school with work the checkouts at my local one, no escape.
5	Happy caketh day
8	I really need to get more sleep.
20	I just watched this episode the other day. I was MORTIFIED. I like seasoned chicken, but not that kinda season no
20	Literally a post on reddit by a woman being creepily hit on by a neighbor, with his wife's permission. Today.
10	That's not what follows from that at all.
20	Did he use his full title when he introduced himself. Cause that would be sweet
6	I'm struggling to find what you're referring to here, could you maybe add something that points to it?
11	Do your worst. The tag just describes your views. Could have been much more vicious.
23	Ha, that would be a novel experience. He'd better let me deal with it.
5	That's how you're supposed to serve a pretzel, so it doesn't go soggy whilst lying flat on a plate. 
20	Sweaty little incel virgin
0	Um excuse me the static reflectives are the best v2s period.
20	10 mg Trintellix and 1.5 mg Vraylar
0	I was actually coming here to add a comment about her! She‚Äôs so cute and talented!
20	Asides from the max number of choices each share, probably being shamed on the internet
4	Baby you was right
5	Had she gone into the left shoulder before braking she may have had a chance.
1	Well shit, if all you gorgeous people haven‚Äôt settled down yet, there‚Äôs no hope for me

3	I feel like it took for fucking ever actually. Still too fast, but anything would be

20	She looks like a crackhead.
0	"If [NAME] had served all fast food buffet to a football team Reddit would be circlejerking ""So down to earth and amazing!!1"""
11	Thank you! I will take that warning under consideration. History is brutal but there's detail and unnecessary detail.
27	Omg lmfao!!
20	I mean, I know you are being sarcastic, but your words are too accurate for something a supporter would actually say 
2	Outraged suburban white moms ranting about stupid things that don‚Äôt matter and making ridiculous comparisons are peak humor
10	"[NAME], I thought we warned you about trying to collect ""data"" from this place."
15	Oh sorry I gotcha
0	Great. I guess they learned from previous shutdowns.
23	I never really thought of myself as an ex-[RELIGION] until recently, so many no.
2	The bourgeoisie elected courts were going to backtrack on all [NAME] economic reforms. Fuck those guys.
17	Ignorance is bliss
20	[NAME] likes a Pacific plan, too.
18	Nope, midwest. I'd bet there are a bunch of shops with the same stuff though. P.S. I love your name!
5	Good luck!
20	It more means nuxia needs help.
13	Oh you're the life of the party.
20	[NAME] sucks. Rally killee
2	It won't make them worse off. GDP is simply irrelevant. Rent and job conditions are what matters.
0	[NAME] consistently being the guy with most energy. We need him on the floor more.
2	I considered becoming a teacher, but then I considered the little bastards would eat me alive.
1	The line the reviews were not positive made me laugh for some reason.
15	Thanks so much for taking the initiative to do this! Not all heroes wear capes :)
20	There are dozens of us.
13	You should check out my comment at the bottom of this thread of why I somewhat support antifa. This comic is obviously fearmongering conservatives.
7	It goes a long way to explaining American mental health issues. Have you ever bothered to read anything?
25	Let's keep making that trade with different teams until we have all 32 picks in the 6th round one year Sorry, I'll go back to my NHL19
2	Holy crap, what happened to that guy?
18	OMG she reminds me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps! I'm in love!
5	Obviously the super sisters will save her.
9	Yo but that RivaL lineup tho! That's gonna be so sick
10	Those are hoteps. They're delusional idiots; no one takes them seriously.
4	Ouch. Rough year for the jags. Where upstate are you?
3	It's interesting that you don't address anything but just come to troll
17	Nae bother, Happy to bring musical joy in to any household.....
20	Eh, not in Europe, it ain't.
0	[NAME]¬≤ ~~good play btw~~
20	My knees, I had to quit running because they got so bad. Even hiking starts hurting after awhile, especially on long downhills Also glasses and deep voices
1	That's the funniest mental image I've had in a very long time!
4	I guess the caveat is that is a world championship offyear where not all players are available due to playoffs
23	Seems kind of literal
15	Many people from 2004 played Fortnite too. You know, because it's a good game and not everyone likes to hate on things arbitrarily.
20	I mean, if it‚Äôs rotten food, especially fruit, mixed with various meats and maybe some seafood- you can get a pretty mean stench going. 
20	Obvious troll is obvious.
1	My favorite is this gem where [NAME] told [NAME] to stop whining and there is no election rigging..two weeks before the election
7	to 6:30. Does that look fake to you?
6	Doesn't help that it's not actually cheese. Looks like a pretty standard Vegan mac+whatever you wanna call it
0	My stylist is a fit, handsome guy with big, sexy hands. Can't say I don't like it when he tousles my hair.
0	All without a red circle, color me impressed.. 
4	I have a college-level understanding of biology, as it is my degree of choice. Those 8th-graders are completely right. 
2	Even if it‚Äôs available 24/7 on your new website 99% of it is ugly so people still won‚Äôt buy it.
17	Griefing your oponents is amazing fun in a pvp game. *Cheating* to grief is the problem being addressed here.
20	This means bisexual
20	[NAME] and [NAME] did alright together. They were both disappointed with the outcome (initially at least) but Under Pressure was a huge hit.
13	It‚Äôs amazing.
20	It‚Äôs probably down to low player base.
20	Where did I state I wanted to keep Syria going? Is making things up just a usual part of your arguements?
0	I love your username
4	He‚Äôd definitely get dropped at some point and then all hell will break loose
27	Oh baby a triple!
4	Oh you'd prefer if I used this pic instead? I understand.
20	Yep, she's completely isolated. Part of the abuse.
2	WHO'S EVEN ON THE ROSTER AGAIN? FUCK, [NAME]? [NAME]?
18	I actually currently have a girlfriend and I love her. It's just that those past situations gave me trust issues for life I guess.
0	Great trade for us but we're losing some forward depth in [NAME]. Tbh though I would be willing to take the risk.
4	You need to recheck your science. A simple Google search will yield research articles showing a biological and genetic basis for being LGBT. Happy reading!
9	I want to see that too, but we all know it's not going to happen.
3	[NAME] just commented on my comment with links to the pamphlet! ‚ÄòTis real!
20	AT doing some work!
10	I was worried about that too honestly
10	True, but it all started under [NAME] and will get even worse if Labour manages to get into government. 
17	Nice try with your 1/3 pan and t rex arms there buckaroo /s
20	You may have been watching a tad too hard bro lol No judgment here
20	American conservatism has been stolen by the neo Nazi, bigoted crowd. [NAME], [NAME], et al would vilify these hacks.
27	With those pieces I‚Äôd be surprised üòí
10	Seems like an odd hypothetical question to ask.
5	I'm sorry I watched that
3	I honestly do not know. Chastise them for their hardness of heart and presumptiveness I suppose. I guess that is what [NAME] would do.
20	It sounds like you project a lot of anger...maybe letting things go, relaxing and slowing down is your solution.
0	so nice i had to put her twice
20	Just stop.
6	Maybe it was. I don't really understand what the point you're trying to make here is.
12	Understand their point of view, 13 IS too young. Imagine how they felt when they found out their innocent child was watching adult videos.
3	2 warm days and we all lose our minds? :)
20	Bah gawd that drop step fake pass turnaround jumper is [NAME] move! They really love each other!
4	Sure it's okay. Very sorry for your loss. Your dad's posts kept me coming back here when I was just a lurker. Much appreciation.
0	Great write up, you‚Äôve sold me on Munchak being a good hire.
20	[NAME] is a murderer,a psychopath and he wants just to kill him
20	Yeah maybe they'll finally get a shred of evidence in another two years haha
18	WE LIKE SPORTZ AND WE DON‚ÄôT CARE WHO KNOWS
10	McRibs are back on the menu but not in the Washington DC metro area.
9	Not possible to change da truth
2	¬£10 for copy pasting a wall of text from /r/gamerghazi? Why would I want to do that.
0	You couldn't even figure those out? Wow. Speechless.
4	I feel ya man. Stayed up to prestige and now I can‚Äôt sleep anyways.
4	Teachers today complain, but zero tolerance does prevent the whole bull-whip/beat-to-death scenarios.
3	Solid. Giving the other customer sauces for free was especially petty, I like.
20	Nice story. Which I guess is why it's #3 in the sub right now :)
20	Trust me no one getting caught but this dumb MF
11	It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about
21	I did. In a selfless sacrifice that I hope brings ample awards.
4	He looks like [NAME] soooo... accurate.
20	Upvote for buttfuckme.
20	This just in: we‚Äôre all FAKES because of [NAME]
20	I'm not sure you know what a [NAME] is
18	I love Ashtray
4	You may be onto something. Strange that I agree with this now.
0	No no this sub has so much to offer. So many great pictures to see. You have a great place here.
20	Ahhhhh you should start screaming and flailing. What a piss poor argument. Now I believe in invisible dragons.
15	Thanks [NAME]. We hardly knew ye
0	Excellent jobs, young men!
3	This is the most adorable thing I've seen in a long time. I hope the intro went well.
0	You look awesome in this picture

15	Thanks! I‚Äôll be sure to do that!
2	QB Coach too? Shit..
20	I already know what they're dealing with, i just cant help without hurting them emotionally or lying to them
9	This shirt IS a problem. Get rid of it.
15	Thanks. Timeless and eternal right?
20	I believe you. Have you compared them to any other designs of headphones in the same price range though?
3	You people really overestimate how much welfare actually covers. You act like one child is making six figures and giving their entire family an MTV Cribs lifestyle.
20	Not all idiots with guns put others in danger. Many just have bad sense with guns. An even smaller percent actually causes damage to people.
27	I'm not saying to hate them, I'm wondering why this sub just started worshiping them.
4	Well that‚Äôs just like, your opinion, man
10	Not [NAME]! He had 0.9% kick to selfs so he'll probably keep bunging them in from the goal square and not getting any stats.
14	I'm working on it. But there is always the fear lurking around....
27	Surprised he didn‚Äôt get hit with a random drug test
13	I‚Äôm desperate for it. I once got to lie in bed with a girl friend a couple times. That was cool. But we barely touched.
4	I REALLY should get my breaks checked.
20	But what if he feels like his position is appealing to those the [NAME] have left behind?
3	"Have her listen to the ""year of poligamy"" podcast. You realize that polygamy was more f'd up than you could ever imagine. "
4	Yeah. Unless you live in a desert, ditch the scarcity mindset. It can keep you in relationships that aren't any good.
20	People need to relax. [NAME] as the 5th starter is fine. Look at his road splits. Limit his starts at home.
4	Except of course that's not what I said. Autists like you like to live in a fantasy life.
20	Myers Briggs test is like the star sign for a different kind of nerd
10	American democracy is weak but it's not dead. If the intention of your comment was to discourage people from voting then you are the problem.
10	You're not [NAME] about your joke, good pun there mate
11	Finally, I can sit on another person‚Äôs lap and have them not be disgusted
20	Hi [NAME]? You mean like what we say when the night manager comes into work?
0	You‚Äôre a gorgeous bride! :D I love the looks you chose
27	Please give us updates. Oh wow.
0	that's one amazing thought! All the best! we are with you!
20	This must have been the fastest reply I've ever gotten omg
3	To bad for you.
23	Huh... I'm left handed and have never realised I do this.
20	Exactly. My father is part of Homeland security and is furloughed. Homeland Security isn't completely shut down but they furloughed part of their work force.
9	This is a depressing r/tworedditorsonecup
22	We may destroy the rest of the world in the process.
0	I spent a week in Ottawa one night. Amazing architecture but awful, filthy, drug infested city. Terrible ppl and a dirty trash hole.
20	Interestingly enough I think it just needs to be the heavy creamer, my wife has some sensitivities to some dairy but not all forms of it. 
20	Seeing the past doesn't mean being in the past
20	[NAME] is getting the shit beat out of him and can't get a call
18	I get it from (very Welsh) grandmotherly types at my work. Like they‚Äôre lovely but I‚Äôm 24??
20	There were people who knew about that before Vice. Not me, but people.
18	This actually sounds like cyberpunk slang, I love it
0	Wow. I dig that.
20	I was waiting for this comment
20	Voting for representatives to govern on your behalf isn't direct democracy. That is when the people directly vote on issues themselves.
11	Calling people on the internet ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù... sweet [NAME] I love this sub. The cringe hurts so good.
10	Sorry. I am avoiding arguments today. Enjoy the video.

2	THE PACK RUNS DEEP AND HARD. I WOULD SHARE MY KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE WITH YOU ANY DAY. AROOOOOOOOO
11	I just saw a snot nosed brat eat a croissant on the subway and got crumbs all over and the snobby rude mom left like nothing happened .
23	Yeah -- a woman who expects a guy to never even think about other women for the rest of his life is a special kind of delusional.
18	I love it! Guy in front can steer, can't propel. Guy in back can propel, but can't steer.
20	[NAME] is a vile excuse for a human being and a stereotypical, alt-right, [NAME] supporter.
20	I wish I could say the same. This is where I come to confront white supremacists. r/CompleteAnarchy and r/ChapoTrapHouse too.
4	Money, specifically other people‚Äôs money in large quantities.
11	I hate beer. But I'll concede the point because others like it. ;)

8	I have literally been waiting for a ‚Äú [NAME]‚Äù I‚Äôm from Ontario Canada and love Texas.
3	This is the technically correct answer, but it still sucks considering how much of society rides on women managing their menstrual cycles.
0	Sell all bch for bitcoin and hope for a bull run. Best decision you probably will make in your life.
20	Let him be happy with this thought! Karma would break his ego sooner or later !
3	I‚Äôm thinking so, since the sides are spiky and somewhat serrated.
21	good luck! I wish you the best <33
9	I'm not a health threat. I'm vaccinated and have no children. Thanks again for your uninformed analysis.
10	The claim that whole milk is 40% fat is surprisingly not the most absurd part of this picture. /j
20	you can anything you want when you have jordan bone
5	Sorry bucko r/necrophilia got taken down, I think your in the wrong place buddy. Here I‚Äôll call you an Uber, take care of yourself.

3	Where‚Äôs the joke? I can‚Äôt even figure out why someone would laugh at this.

2	Dig up, stupid! 
6	Did people really go against [NAME] when he came out? I wasn't as in to his stuff at the time but I remember people being supportive.
4	Abso-goddamn-lutely. It‚Äôs the only thing I can think of that can make otherwise rational people defend rape, murder, genocide and slavery. 
0	Watching [NAME] cry made me cry. That dude worked his ass off his entire career for that moment. So well deserved.
10	No.. that's the exact opposite of what they are.
3	Lol the fact that actual fans can't afford tickets is why there are let's go heat chants at this game

3	>if your car is so great why do you have to fill it with petrol all the time This is how stupid you sound

20	That [NAME] part killed me!

0	Trusting readers is something we cannot afford in this day and age.
10	There has to be some repercussions for this judge, right? Considering the crimes, that bail seems incredibly low...

1	That poor girl. She wants to run in the rain and her mean ole momma won't let her. LOL
10	We all make acceptable compromises to maintain relationships. If that‚Äôs part of you and it‚Äôs unacceptable to him then he can change his choice.
5	Don‚Äôt let the bastards grind you down. I‚Äôm so sorry for this experience. No one deserves to be treated that way.
14	It just never got weird enough..
20	Disaster!!
6	Alright thanks, I was so confused for a sec. Thought [NAME] pointed to an uneven bump on the ground 
3	Meh, it just keeps players from diving in taking stupid damage. (At least it should.)
3	I watched that worm fish sauce thing. So gross, disgusting, bleh, NO,NO, and HELL NO!!

26	I'm so sorry
18	You see, when a router and a hard drive love each other very much...

23	Ah from what I understood you could barely read the biggest line on the chart. I thought this was a general statement.
3	I don't know what she is talking about. Therefore i will say that she is DEFINITELY WRONG AND SHOULD SHUT UP! /s

20	Poor lady, she was the mother of a friend of my wife, and she went to school with my father in law :(

7	Two different writers have two differing opinions??? I'm shocked, just absolutely shocked, I tell you!
6	Wait, did this really happen? I'd like to see that video so I can cringe some more plz.
20	I don't think cryptocurrency is ready for such using. Although in Asian countries like Singapore or Hong Kong it's quite acceptable I guess.
5	Just know that you are the man. Go Isles. Go Flames.
10	There have been multiple threads about this, they can't afford to move up. It's not financially feasible.
6	It was never implied as such. You simply mistakenly interpreted it that way.
20	-no scary creatures trying to kill you- Ha! You haven't heard of Rhode Islanders yet! /s
15	I'm sorry to hear that things went down like that. Good luck with everything.
10	What can you expect from guys who think everything based on sex and romance is solely based on a person‚Äôs looks and not at all their personality?
21	Good luck!!! üíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú

21	as someone who dealt with a burn out/mental break down 4 years ago, /s/ this post makes me feel very optimistic about the future /s/
10	It's just a human problem. I lose track of how many stories a month come out about some teacher getting caught sexually abusing 1-3 of her students.
17	And he was like ‚Äúumm you woke me up for this, [NAME]?!‚Äù Lmao. That made me laugh.
4	I totally agree and I think this was suggested before as well
3	 It an argument. Don‚Äôt really have time for jack-assery. Lot of people want attention from me tonight, not just you.

26	His wrists are too small ‚òπÔ∏è
20	You'll find a few down South, too. No surprise.
15	Thank you!!! I'll do this now!!!
20	This is not Texas exclusive slang. I've lived in the Midwest and the east coast, everyone uses this slang...
25	Oh my lord I am so sorry. That is just despicable. Internet hugs.
20	The views that are pro-apartheid and pro-ethnic cleansing are illegitimate, whether or not they are ‚Äú[RELIGION] views‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter.
20	Just out of curiosity, what happened with the big dog?
20	His! Watch out! That cars coming straight for you! Omg guys she‚Äôs arguing with ferrah, she can‚Äôt hear us help!
3	Looks deliriously boring.
2	The FDA has plenty to criticize. But like here, it's usually criticized horribly off base. It needs to grow some balls and actually enforce things.

17	I would not be surprised seeing as both picked up [NAME] and the other [NAME].

6	Are you [NAME]?
2	What in the actual fuck....
4	Your desperate attempts to pretend that this is nothing are...really weird, to be totally honest.
4	That‚Äôs reasonable
0	Thanks [NAME] for moderating, I appreciate the hard work you guys do!
20	Mod like that should get doxxed honestly.
10	No but it would be weird if you masturbated to it like I did
0	It's such a relieving feeling to know you're finally gone. You never have to go back. You are so strong you got this!!
3	How mature of you. Resorting to name-calling is delightfully childish. I expected nothing less.
18	I mean I like the park and I was surprised by that poll too
20	That's exactly what I thought too!!!!
20	We do have Uber. I use it the odd time. The main difference is that here it's taxis only due to regulations.
20	Very excited for what could come from his presidency, very much not excited for the primaries.
20	oof okay, thanks for the info. Hopefully he fares better with our line/TE's

25	Season x? Sorry bitch but no.
20	They dont mind a second trump term if [NAME] 2020 looks likely
15	Thank you kind internet stranger for listening to me. I feel a little less alone for the moment.

3	Yes, clearly u/backwoodmenace was repeating misinformation intentionally.
7	But who is filming him?
3	Yheaaa I always gave me till 35 to decide if I want a kid or not. [NAME] kicked in sooner than expected.
0	Video games are great, but sometimes it‚Äôs nice to unplug and play a game of Jenga with your cat

9	I bid my condolences to any player who did not experience release day action. ‚Äú*Glorious battles, tooth and nail* *Noobs arrived, our matches grew stale*‚Äù
20	I really try to not use that terminology as it is inconsistent and was made up by people who know little to nothing about firearms.

4	"""Thanks for showing me your red flags within the first 10 seconds of interaction."""
15	Thank you. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.
21	You also have the option of making it quite unique. Would be a delight to see if you got it!
10	Men don‚Äôt have it worse but at least society cares about women.

20	That has to be an understatement, I know several myself
4	I've been really into reading nonfiction lately and ancient religious history sounds fascinating! Do you have any books you recommend?
7	I'm not sure anyone has asked, and feel free to not answer. But is your feeling that the team definitely favors [NAME] right now? 
4	"I honestly thought that they could have chosen ""bigger"" words than those, [NAME] clearly knew what they meant!"
13	Every time I see MCC news I get briefly excited for PC news. I really need to stop :(
20	How the hell
20	I also always wear a condom with straight guys. Who knows where they‚Äôve been...
20	Communism naturally results in dictatorship. When you centralize power, you invite the power-hungry. Every morally-motivated communist seems to think they're immune to the bullets of power-hungry totalitarians. 
20	The latter is correct.
1	Especially the jellies, they come up so fast!
26	[NAME] dude I‚Äôm sorry. That‚Äôs their problem now. Bump some [NAME] and keep moving forward.
2	Oh I just hate her character. Personally her kit is super fun. But I don't like her character at all
20	I literally have more friends on HOTS than WOW. Wow is deader than hots.

18	I‚Äôd love to flatten [NAME] emotions.
20	This is what happens when you don‚Äôt beat up the nerd enough
11	The way colt talks in that weird calm voice is like a psychopath. I hate it. It‚Äôs so condescending and creepy.
9	Meanwhile my sister won‚Äôt even hug my goodbye when I drop her off at school.
20	I think [NAME] was pulled in that moment into the ‚ÄúWorld between Worlds‚Äù just as [NAME] on Malachor.

4	Yeah Eagles definitely had the upper hand in the negotiation but there‚Äôs no way we were gonna waste a season with [NAME] at QB.
6	Maybe that's why she was trying to buy a firearm. To lead the fight against the alien invasion.
3	Man we better not lose this like the [NAME] game.
10	That‚Äôs part of why I hate porn so much - other than the exploitation of women
20	He claims the starting job and we make the playoffs, I think it would be hard to argue against him.

14	You're analogies are terrible and prove the opposite of what you were arguing, numb skull üòÇ
26	I can‚Äôt work, wish I could. Worked hard my whole life and lost literally everything a few years ago. 20 years down the drain.
26	Poor and lonely.

1	His laptop lol
20	You just worded it badly, like we all SHOULD want to see it change, which many of us don‚Äôt.
20	Exactly right about throwing $23M at Donaldson. I mean, are we going for it this year or not? Mixed signals...
10	Seen plenty of women's marches with so called feminists wearing hijabs even though that is not a symbol of freedom.
14	It bothers me that certain people praise him as an entertainer and could care unless about what he did. Look at [NAME]... Makes me question humanityü§î

20	This South Florida girl loves Jaxons Ice Cream. Seeing the kitchen sink makes me want to drive home.
27	23 minutes! Omg that's too long
10	This is pretty bad advice. Do not use dreams own encryption. And do not use things such as igolder
11	this is my worst fear
20	You can. I've used my Kroger-linked phone number while travelling to other states with success.
20	Your x and his mother are the only other people there and you‚Äôve gotta work together to bake a cake.

22	felt like that shot by palms was our first in a while
21	I'm in. Hopefully I don't end up on the dumpster fire that is the Oilers
10	I am very thankful for that. And thankful I wasn‚Äôt totally brainwashed
20	I don't control the Lib Dems, shockingly.
11	No. No it isn't. Its a bad sitcom joke.

20	But you've been openly critical of men's rights and have defended feminism.

6	I believe they use some tissue from the urethra that creates some small amount of lubrication.
15	Thanks I will try to delete the multiples. Good luck on everything.

6	Shadowbanning me isn‚Äôt good policy either

4	you dont have to sign up for anything, just literally paste the output of the script.

2	You're just a fuming democrat and all I hear is angry democrat mental gymnastics.
20	He's likeable but the pace of a game on live tv is too much for him. He'd definitely be better suited as a halftime guy
3	He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting!

20	Marry her!
9	What a nasty goal! Gives you chills!

20	And you can't really see the bottom part so that's probably small too. Really grosses me out

25	Damn didn‚Äôt see it sorry
20	[NAME] and [NAME]. There really is NO point of them staying and they are unbearable to watch.

20	You‚Äôre doing gods work.

20	Make sure he gets some glucosamine(!)
10	They‚Äôre also communist, so that puts them above their reproach
6	"In what way is banning someone from using your service for copyright theft ""a completely over-the-top punishment"" ?"

20	I think they were planing to be tag team Rapists to a much younger you. I‚Äôm so glad you cancelled.
6	i thought you were and [NAME] too?
20	You‚Äôre gonna miss some high quality content. Just this month he‚Äôs posted two mirror selfies and mentioned [NAME] a chill 5,000 times. 
20	So you‚Äôve never had a fwb situation and if you have it made you worthless for a real relationship to other women? Hope this goes both ways
2	You conveniently forgot nearly killing a toddler by throwing furniture out of a 14 story window.
15	DDR is enjoying a bit of a renaissance at the moment, thanks to DDR A. Hopefully this will lead Konami to considering a new home release.

7	I was wondering this too. Whatever it was it's over now.
21	Good luck with the interview!
20	We need to get some away wins now more than ever. 2nd half of the season, no more time to be circle jerking each other! 
8	That, but I also really think that [NAME] is going to be a top QB. Especially, if he progresses during his time as back up.
20	"For liquids I might leave the ""7"" out and make sure your citizens are the only race that can spawn in highly savage areas."

1	TIL that TYL that this is both of their jokes. Even if it was like that is funny.
4	What's it matter where this came from? It fits every content guideline and we're enjoying it.
18	I like this rule because in life there are always exceptions. The problem is when you start feeling entitled to *being* that exception.
6	I didn't know they made phone calls ...
13	I am real excited for this, I just hope they don‚Äôt ruin it.
10	Does nobody notice that this is a doctored photo..?? Like really bad clone stamp.. I mean it could be beautiful but this is not a real photo.

4	I needed this laugh like... damn. This comment is just as good as the OP and the OP is pretty amazing. üôå
15	Thanks man, appreciate it :D
3	That guy is being intentionally obtuse. Down vote trolls are a waste of everyone's time.

3	It's time to feel the fucking Bern, America. 
20	‚ÄúWe just need more MONEY!‚Äù
14	I‚Äôm feeling the same about the nets and hornets. I‚Äôm only worried the hornets can‚Äôt cover
23	Obviously, there's only a few inches, but I could never really see any improvement. i thought it would be a good supplement option for you.
18	I love happy endings.
0	Poetic and also true.
15	Good luck! Hockey season still has a few months to go. Might wanna invest in a punching bag. Two birds with one stone

2	I hope The pelicans trade him and [NAME] if they trade [NAME]. Hate to see them waste away in NO
3	You don‚Äôt owe anyone your suffering or your future. Ever.
20	I didnt have a single black teacher in my 15 years of schooling. The area defenintly plays a part in that but it's still a bit shocking.
7	How is this a racism?
20	No ENTP would be such a zealot about anything. This is STJ territory
20	No insults.
20	You can see [NAME] weapon on the plane in the background when [NAME] is talking
8	I personally like [NAME] and think he could be on the team right now, but the Org doesn't agree.
20	ahh yes I forgot to include steps 3a *and* 3b. thanks fam

2	Son of a bitch... here we go. Can't just stand there guys....

20	[NAME] we support you! Love from Mexico I hope everything works out for you, whatever you decide to do!
2	[NAME] not calling anything so far. Means they will call everything second half. It‚Äôs inevitable.
9	They didn‚Äôt even ask about her in the phone call. Does that not seem just a tiny bit odd to you? HONEST ANSWER PLEASE
10	"Why does your flair say ""Wasted Energy""? "
25	Well the left wants to defend [RELIGION]. Good, now that they‚Äôre on your side of the table. Own it, or denounce it

13	Ooooh, we got a badass over here!
20	This is my hat now... this is totally my hat...
20	I actually do have a really good one who specializes in emp law. He serves multiple areas. Will pM
0	I was there on the opposite side of the field. I did not believe he made that catch until we saw it later on tv. Unreal.

20	Yeah this is definitely a wooosh.

6	I‚Äôm not sure why they thought it was cute, but this is what that alluded 
15	i appreciate your response! you are totally right... i gottA get out of my head.
4	Same. Even while not on my period I have lower back pain
8	Yes the ammo health thing really is a chore. Too much realism. we want have some fun in a realistic setting, not a simulator. 
20	[NAME] needs to come in now. There will be so much space for him
20	Probably also saves money. An extra 3 napkins you dont use each time multiplied by thousands of people per day adds up quick
4	I know what you mean. I'm actually looking for a [NAME] irl. That's hard to find...
10	I partly disagree. In an argument that stupid, whoever writes more text than the other person is inevitably the bigger moron.
0	Wow those latkes look even worse than I thought they would.
0	You‚Äôre an inspiration
17	Reminds me of when we used to have an RB named [NAME] while [NAME] was at Texas

1	Wtf if this is true it‚Äôs the funniest thing I‚Äôve read all day.
20	"I don't always do this, but when I do, I'm listening to the unedited version of ""Killing In The Name Of""."
19	Well you needn't worry about it I won't be coming back to that floating turd you call a country

1	Hahahah thank you so much, username does not check out, you don't seem sketchy at all! üòÖ
9	Because physical contact promotes bonding. Healthy relationships increase both partner's wellbeing. Routine can be frustrating. Especially when you want to try something new.
18	Not any meaningful amount as far as I can tell. Although I‚Äôd love to be surprised
1	The players turning on him for crying story cracked me up though.
21	He‚Äôd go down with a mysterious season ending injury
9	Very fake news.
20	Hail [NAME]!
20	Women are nice. Except when they murder you.
9	The mods deleted it I'm sorry

7	You speak the truth, plain & simple. Yet we‚Äôre the malevolent bad guys! WTH?!
10	And people try to hold that against [NAME] when they should hold that against the Packers organization and Front Office...Their Front Office stopped trying, not [NAME].
6	I didn‚Äôt know it was gonna be that simple Forgive me [NAME] :D
20	Watching now. Oh wow we both didn't realize how much we hated this guy. This is one of the most quotable episodes by far.
15	Great post, thanks for coming here and sharing.
17	its funny because they dont even do anything at the look out tower but stargaze
21	I might be stupid but I thought [NAME] wore #16?
3	I mean that‚Äôs a stupid rule that creates an echo chamber, but I don‚Äôt see how that belongs here.
20	And when I went to your moms house she told me about her super awesome witty son.
18	I love humans
10	I don't think fantasy draft has been a thing for a few years in career mode.
20	Devastating and true.
20	Maybe he thought they meant HOKEY!!!! Like ‚Äúthe hokey pokey‚Äù. Lol
8	Happy New Year to you too!
6	I'm not sure if [NAME] is visiting the Podesta pizza party.
26	French fried when he should have pizza'd and had a bad time.
7	19 is still considered a teen right? If so, here I am! At least until March. 
20	Sounds like you had a much rougher night than me. You win this round
15	This actually took me a minute. I underestimate the skill and knowledge of people in this subreddit. Very good.
0	I'm glad we picked a coach who's shown he is great at developing our young talent which is the true focus of this season
20	[NAME] what's your opinion on this?
0	Oh really. Go ahead and try to reason with an [RELIGION] government that their power should be limited. Good luck.
5	Man hope he recovers fast. Looked really painful
20	I‚Äôm going off memory for the FLDS and the show ‚Äúsister wives‚Äù so I could be totally wrong.
17	I live for this comment üôåüèª i just thought it was me getting older and losing touch with whats ‚Äútrendy‚Äù but am glad its equally hated
8	Pretentious erection is going to be the name of the lawyer funk band that I‚Äôm going to bring into existence someday.

20	Sure, okay.
20	Oh. That's an... Interesting username. :
20	"I've felt number 2 so hard. ""Working hard for what you don't want"" is a thing. :("
4	This reminds me of when it came out that the Hello Kitty! character is actually a human girl.
20	Unless something changed I'm pretty sure you can't add flairs on the default Reddit app.
20	[NAME] is talking about another human in this world getting horny in an fashion he does not approve of.
18	I like how the Red Tie Legion chose a picture where he‚Äôs tieless for their shitty-ass meme.
3	As a 29 year old newly married man, I still do some cringey stuff from time to time. 
20	I wish my mom was catgirl savvy.
27	Oh damn it! I was just on my way to the post box
25	The problem is your husband. If he prioritized you, he would have figured something out. I‚Äôm so sorry.
3	And the douche social media obsessed guy who left the used condom on the side table!
21	I always hope that a woman will ask me out...next time it happens will be the first.
20	That was at Nats Park. I remember that poor guy.
8	She still cute tho
0	Glad she reads the comments of every [NAME] Facebook post ever
4	The best one for me is still Borderlands 2, and it‚Äôs been a fucking while. Amazing how far ahead of its time that game was.

0	That guy at the start with the hat reminds me of [NAME]
20	* Make sure you've got more than enough to eat at home
20	Honestly I thought it just meant any game where you couldn't choose Casual mode... which is everything pre-Awakening.
4	That's because he played the end of the game when they were feeding [NAME] with no results.
15	Thanks all. It was a league game in our local bar. The dealer rotates on each hand. Lesson learned from me.
6	most conservatives have been pissed at cities in Minnesota raising the age to buy tobacco, I guess i'm a little confused on what you are talking about.
10	These are worse than the [NAME] ones [NAME]
17	But, it entertains you.... in some way. Thats the point dude.
1	[NAME] üòÇ I‚Äôm sorry they weren‚Äôt as expected but thank you for sharing! I had a good giggle.
20	Wow they are on the cusp here. Definitely not fellowkids because I would totally believe an actual fellow kid said this
20	STAY TO THE RIGHT
7	What no one in the history of time has ever recovered from a bad first date? Hard pass on this anecdotal evidence.
15	Take a upvote I'm glad I made your experience great
20	When it's the same composer, this kind of thing is bound to happen.
4	Yeah, and I always thought the dude in these comics was supposed to be like 30 years old. 
4	Low life is as low life does. I wouldn't be too surprised if he's broke by the time he's middle aged, unfortunately.
5	Do you remember if [NAME] was carrying a white piece of paper? Oh yeah...you don't forget a thing like that...
3	Woooooooooo it took long enough but the UYU boys finally did it and made the league
0	Ok, thanks for the clarification. I don't find it compelling but I appreciate your time and patience.
4	Wait, this is an actual music video you're describing, and not like... a Family Guy bit?
15	Thank you! :)
3	This is not a good formation. We‚Äôve been over this. It just ends up being crossed lobbed into the box by [NAME]
4	Does your son do Scratch? My daughter doesn't do fortnite but Scratch is her favourite internet thing and she would love to add new scratch friends.
24	Thanks for saying that, it wasn't easy ... definitely sparked a long period of discussion and reflection!
20	That would never pass since every side would get what they want. There has to be a loser in his eyes
20	not sure why people are downvoting you saying youre a hurricane fan
20	You people.
10	His sentences don‚Äôt contradict. You just have poor comprehension.
4	You‚Äôre right but territories haven‚Äôt been around for decades
13	I remember running into teachers at the grocery store or whatever when I was a little kid and having that same feeling!
18	Genoa likes [NAME]
6	You guys actually look really similar to me besides the hair/beard. But that's not a bad thing!
1	Hahahaha. This. This right here. üòÇ
20	Same, I just want to see her get eaten by a flamingo on rollerskates
10	Ha, my husband goes out after you guys have done your thing and checks for himself, he's been burned too many times.
2	What the hell are you on about now? Those are some weird examples to go with your clarified opinion.
3	Sweaty irritates me. But Its not exactly drag lingo. I've seen it on so many other subs too.
20	Sexy Unique Podcast (SUP) for all your VPR needs!

21	No problem, hope things get better for you guys soon!
0	You are a true hero
17	His Batman/TMNT book is a really fun read with great art.
20	A 12 million sub channel has value. Wouldn't be surprised if it's been hollowed out ready to be sold and rebranded.
3	His chin is recessed. How the fuck does he have decent lower face
17	im glad they have it but this should have really been introduced in DMC3
13	It‚Äôs a party and we‚Äôre all invited
4	Woah. This is a whole new fascinating Reddit thing that I never knew about
10	I mean yeah that's really it. Getting him on tape saying racist stuff is the only possibility of a sale.
20	If New Jersey are going to win it in the winter they better get something done quickly..
7	Why do you think he's right? What reason would a nonprofit newsroom have for publishing sensationalist headlines?
20	Psst...If no one sees you while eating it, you didn't actually eat it
20	It's pinned on the sub.
2	> She fucked my bumper up and I will forever hate her And her insurance didn't repair it because???
13	My favourite moment of the game by my favourite player.
10	> [NAME] That is going to get sooo confusing if he does join our division.
21	I just walked past y'all! Wish I had seen this thread earlier.
0	Oh, but amazingly it seemed to work out in the end because oil eating bacteria evolved in the Gulf of Mexico
3	OH SUCK ME SIDEWAYS
0	[NAME] looks wayyyyyy happier to be there than he did at the Columbus press conference last week.
20	Too right. I hate the Sun. worst tabloid out there
3	The oldest Millennial is 38, so mot surprising you don't know how
20	It‚Äôs cheaper to track her phone.
20	Cognitive dissonance. I don't support diagnosis via internet but she needs medical help NOT a medical license.
10	Surely the error is lexical. And I think the original comment is poor (non native) idiom use
10	Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt want to poop without my phone either. Gotta scroll reddit while I‚Äôm poopin!
20	Have you actually seen the pictures of her scratches? There‚Äôre not on her stomach at all, they‚Äôre on her side and back.
3	> I don‚Äôt understand the boot-licking mentality Calling it in 5 years. That's your future AP.
10	Love this game, can't stand the combat system. It's just not for me. 
15	Sweet thanks for the update. I hope the kitty finds a good home
8	Then let's go scythe and HAMMER!!! I've actually wanted scythe and hammer for the longest too
4	Kids Day in Toronto, Leafs STHs donate their tickets to kids so there's like 10,000 kids in the arena today. Pretty cool thing they started last year
11	Terrible shade of lipstick she's wearing...
20	"""Don't eat pork! Not even with a fork!"""
20	OP literally said guys like [NAME] are not unicorns and not hard to find. They never said [NAME] was the ultimate standard lol
25	I stand corrected, my apologies to the mods. I'd personally like to see more banned or removed but at least they handled the most egregious.
10	Nope. Just running from people wielding axes like a normal person. Instead of acting like a tough guy on the internet like you.
5	Just remember to refrigerate it and not leave it out.
2	I DON'T KNOW. The loneliness goes from mental pain to physical discomfort and pain.
18	[NAME] my favorite character ü§£
15	Good point. Thank you. My condolences for your own loss.
21	Oh sorry dude, I was just looking for the WiFi password. [NAME], but I hope you stay safe

0	This post is amazing. Definitely starting to see good days and life just kept improving after my Nex. Thank you for this
21	I think she said he hit her through the car window
8	there needs to be a win, fail or something related to alcohol. Theres none; just a girl dancing and you faping:
17	Congratulations, it is satire!
20	Tucking your jeans into your sock makes you look like a goober...
20	Go find your own [NAME]!!!
15	Yes. Exactly. Anything non [NAME] belongs in the trash. Glad you agree.
3	I mean clearly it's because they don't understand the pricing for babies/young children on the black market.
11	It definitely revealed how ugly the hatred on the Left has gotten.
20	I have even gotten to have sex with women who were fellow comics nerds and also hated what movies have done to [NAME] stories!
24	That's how you think hes trying to input something. Glad it was my way home.
20	This is one of the identity issues I was referring to in my original comment.
3	I dropped him around week 6 and let somebody else deal with that headache
15	Congratulations on your shiny spine! I really hope your boyfriend backs you up but even if not, we all do! 
21	Im looking for this, but I predict a 3-1 win to bar√ßa. I really hope [NAME] doesnt bore me
4	I can easily relate to that as well. The siblings are the ones who will stick with us for the whole journey to the very end.
0	So you are officially saying that record cabinet was not searched prior to the day the key was found? Is this correct?
20	Knew it before I clicked, top notch movie 
20	So which is more profitable for producers, brick n mortar or digital distribution? Which makes more money?
3	Sick comeback. Not really a dirty combo other than the unblockable.
10	I don‚Äôt even like [NAME] that much but she completely failed to engage with his work critically. Her interpretations of his arguments were shockingly poor.
2	i just don‚Äôt think we are aggressive 100% of the time
6	If I'm just reading the headline, it's ambiguous.
20	Everyone forgot to tell you the 1st step is to marry the Sheriff's daughter.
15	That‚Äôs cool. I didn‚Äôt know they had cameras like that. Thank you for sharing :)
20	Mod like that should get doxxed honestly.
18	A few months ago I would have loved that idea. Hard pass now.
0	Beautiful shots. Makes me want to finally take the jump into photography.
1	I was dying when he said we got to make love or be a crime
0	As an autism mum, I can‚Äôt thank you enough. ‚ù§Ô∏è
9	the force awakes wasn't a clear insult, it was just mediocre.
3	Ah, so you're the reason people hate aspies. 
1	No. And not near as much as a gun lol
20	I came I saw He broke His jaw
21	My thoughts exactly, I hope [NAME] doesn't get too much hate.
20	And he's also in the way of playing time for [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]. [NAME] fits better as third option on a playoff team.
3	It's not something i'm proud of, but I definitely fucked up that day.
7	>Feminism is how we get to equality how do you know that?
20	Aye me, it's shite and the folk who follow it all think there cool, bore off
15	Cool, thanks man
20	AND MY ~~AXE~~ MACE
6	I‚Äôd want to know what happens after
13	I really love that game. It's so chill, I played it a lot. 
7	Frankly, partisan politics aside, I would REALLY like to know where this fever dream of historical came from. It's mind boggling.
8	I wish I can go 90 days challenge
20	I'm just reminding everyone. you're not helping the situation by being pedantic
3	We're not exactly short on white homophobes either though.
9	Gold Coast seems like it would go well on paper, but turn up to the actual thing and seems strangely disappointing would be good to tell friends about though
11	[NAME] said it best. Un-fuckin-believable bro
15	Thanks for a different perspective, this made me feel better.
1	very long very messy i usually have it in a bun to keep it under control lol
14	i did, but it was at 3 am before i went to bed, so i‚Äôm gonna cheat and count it as 2018 LOL.
20	Baby dont misunderstand..why cant I be head coach
11	"ick! That makes me feel gross. I have ""Addison's Disease"". "
20	That'll cost ya.
5	our first series against the dbacks on may 31 may be too painful :c but i hope he finds great success there!!
20	Rip ok lol
15	Make sure to tell her /r/Austin helped you pick a place! She'll appreciate the thought you put into choosing a place special to her.
5	Will provably be downvoted into oblivion but you could have used *people* instead of *monsters* and have the point remain intact. Edit: Probably*
7	Is that so bad?
20	Didn't know about him being a teacher. Camp Bucca doesn't mean much though. Plenty of foreign fighters ended up in those type of camps.
0	Very wholesome!
5	I'm worried that [NAME] throwing away a future career by running for President.
9	Pulisic is a replacement for our abysmal right wing.
7	i‚Äôve heard its convenient if its a particularly messy job

10	Trust me it gets worse from there....i shortened it a lot
20	It would seem difficult to say you're living in one city when you're only applying there to expand your reach.
20	They have a local government which governs their reserve, which is elected democratically. It‚Äôs their government, it represents them not anyone who is non-indigenous
21	You can't stop [NAME], you can only hope to contain him
20	I actually really like [NAME]
4	A Visa gift card is a type of Visa card, and you can return money to it just like you can with any other Visa card.
20	We need to fight both opression and the SJWs guys, they don't know the struggle of peeing with a boner
20	Arrow already did break this trend by having a mostly excellent S5, definitely much better than S3 and S4.
4	Look how pretty she is. YES QUEEN YESSSSSSS
4	Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
20	huge fool just like everyone who believes anything [NAME] says weve been two weeks away for months now
17	This makes me smile.
20	That's [NAME] and he had a concussion.
10	Those dont seem exclusive....try both
7	[NAME], I guess you are the one who got whooshed
20	You're way too involved in this. Take a break from the internet.
20	That's my horse!
20	I was going for r/truthtoirony
9	No, though they've been criticised for an alleged anti-gov't bias. 
0	That makes sense. You had a good reaction time. Glad no one was hurt.
26	True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams.
1	Naw man Asain men have an easier time. Most of my asain friend are pretty boy. Fuckbois lol
1	Haha okay. Much love brother!
20	Why should I care what he thinks?

21	errr, nah she'll be dead in both without compesations. less than 40% winrate.
4	I forgot the Olympics was gonna happen there üòÇ hopefully the signs and stuff will stay!
20	Ssssssh, don't tell them. It's a natural way to filter the gene pool from stupid people. 
20	> I‚Äôm tired of being realistic and open minded. Me too! Now it is all about being selfish and aloof. Not even kidding.
26	and as soon as I said ni IPAD tonight, I was like GIRL what the fresh hell is tonight gonna bring! 
20	You'd have to explain what that means to you first. It's such a nebulous phrase it's never meant much of anything to me.
7	Anyone have that mirror?
20	You have no idea how high I can fly.
20	Also: - more snipers - another stealth hero This makes my top 3 of what would make the game even more fun.
1	Also likely selling stolen goods too lol
6	I'm not. He and I still thrive. I hope you're doing alright.
18	Been together 6 years, and I think she's the best person I know. I'm still in the phase where I love her more everyday.
1	Keep on auto aiming bud. One day you'll get good maybe haha.

3	Crows get hungry too you know and it's not like you were sharing
27	Omg I had to crank my tv because I thought it was just low volume
4	I agree with you! Just wishful thinking from me I guess aha!
20	Disturbing =/= awful. Its incredibly well done by a professional. I feel like this sub is more for unintentional awfulness, not purposeful shock value/ theatrical makeup.
1	Some people are pretty dense. That comment was clearly sarcasm, sorry bout your downvotes üòî
20	the libertarian to fascist pipeline is real

10	I don't even love myself that much. I'm glad I wrote myself out of the parenting pool long ago, I'd be terrible at it.
20	My worry about [NAME] is that running former governors hasn‚Äôt worked out the greatest. Especially when his been out of office for 11 years.

0	Triple P Positive Parenting Program is excellent.

2	[NAME] damn it [NAME].

2	He must've done something real bad. I played with a guy who by all counts was an asshole but never received more than mutes.
20	In countries where people had to actually fight against dictatorships and fascism people didn't have uncontrolled access to guns. They barely had guns.
20	"""So... I'm gonna go back to my class and sit in my seat like you told me to, if you don't mind..."""

2	Increase in robberies on pot shops. I really hope not though.
4	Ofcourse. If you can debunk our arguments and stuff,, well you win. Have a nice day too
20	Oh, you thought I was referencing you ... you may well be right.

3	hi [NAME], toxicity in a multiplayer game is something that should always be expected no matter the game cause people are assholes.

15	You people are the one's who got me here! Thanks to everybody who helped me reach 80+K upvotes:)
12	It gives me a weird feeling as someone not named [NAME]. It's a very heeby jeeby inducing phrase.
27	All that and still tweeting about real and perceived insults.
20	For some reasons [NAME] has never had a bad tank line... Runner is onto something
23	The cop should have just shot his kneecap out.
20	[NAME] is a lefty. It's the reason why we had [NAME] punch him out in the division series.

11	Yeah I never tried because I think it's stupid.

1	The point is, 9gag is more focused in providing fun and entertainment, Reddit is too busy changing the world.
20	I hope your pastor issues are resolved quickly and that your new pastor inspires you.

18	I love it when people assume things.

20	[NAME] and [NAME] may be stronger, but [NAME] just gone mad. She's lost the plot for sure.
4	I feel like [NAME] would have laughed at it though. It was a one-liner. I thought it was funny.
9	Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
20	Prove me wrong then. Find another poll that supports your narrative. Until that point my source is what we have to go by.
20	I always have the subtitles on. So I don‚Äôt miss a single üíé!

0	Wow .. this is more terrifying than if they were a ghost ! Amazing twist
20	Well, this is the first time I've seen that in over three years.
11	It's a lot of projection. Pretty much anything they point fingers at others for, is something they're guilty of.
20	"Presumably he was more excited about making her stay with some pedo jerkoff fantasy of ""Stockholm Syndrome"" .. oh she's staying cuz she looooooves me! "

5	I have but one upvote to give, otherwise you would get more.
1	Lol, some guntards stepped out of the echo chamber and sounded completely unhinged.
15	Ofcourse. If you can debunk our arguments and stuff,, well you win. Have a nice day too
15	Thank you :)
20	Yup, even if they had a very rough life... Nobody ages thaaaaaat badly.
11	No. It‚Äôs not. This is disgusting behavior and anyone who supports it is a fool.
15	Thank you, this isn't the first time they have tried to control us with money. They always put odd stipulations on money or gifts.
2	I was, and it's not. He's mad that someone posts articles he disagrees with. Pathetic and his fury is deranged

15	Thank you. I will look into the protein possibility.
0	Sexy teeth.
20	Its cause of [NAME] and the Rams, he basically has 0 control over the defense 
20	I‚Äôm gonna make that a sub. Too many juicy targets not to.
3	I will take it a as serious question. Sorry. I am in Europe
7	Oh I can feel the burn all the way from Australia, even a few months later. Doesn't anyone have a direct source to this post? Thanks
23	No helmet + no shoes + no skill + no sense = exactly what happened

0	Interesting to see the bulk of people in that thread are pretty anti-[RELIGION].
2	#I HATE BOTH EQUALLY
20	Yeah I was talking about a pug right there.
20	All the scumbags around everywhere. Sucks that it's so easy to use for a lot of other things.
10	If so, then LN payments are *not* safer than unconfirmed TXs.
4	Maybe I should tell my family to move the Lavvo further south =) people sound nicer there
5	Heres some well wishes to you staying up

8	"I loved the first single from BO so hopefully the entire album will be good. And has more effort into it than ""WHERE ARE THE JOKES"""
14	We used to do a lot of terrible shit in the past that‚Äôs not a good argument
10	And [NAME] should go sell his wife's ketchup. He's good for nothing else besides selling out our country.
13	Agree. I did enjoy Godless but I was addicted to The Terror. It was full of such amazing character actors.
20	me too. it's a way of keeping distance. feels too intimate to use someone's name.

20	Well who knows Germany was way ahead of its time

12	[NAME] face be like: ‚ÄúWhen you wish you stayed home instead of being embarrassed in front of 100+ million people...‚Äù
0	I thought you were just going to wait her out. You actually engineered her loss of space to someone else. WELL DONE!!!!

15	>I'm just trying to be respectful of the native speakers who did and who prefer it. Literally no one, because it's a made up word
9	I use to get this but now I just get ghosted.
20	Well the last time we got a premier like this, the conservatives didn't get power again until [NAME] and only because [NAME] misstepped at the last second
0	I was entertained into the 4th. My sons played well. We lost. I'll take it.

21	I hope google does this so that everyone would leave them already.

3	The new beserker face ruined him for me. Made him another old, wrinkly hobo.
13	Can't wait for episode 5
20	Ugh. People are the worst!
7	I wonder if it's about a t t e n t i o n s e e k i n g . . .
10	So deport the bad guys and let the asylum seekers come in. Sounds like we don‚Äôt need a wall anyway.
1	"When he read ""don lemon still has a job"" as an example of racial stupidity... I fucking fell out of my chair. LMAO. Love it."
14	watching [NAME] attempt hook shots gives me a panic attack, even when he makes them (which is rare)

20	Problem is the people who don‚Äôt know the difference between a single solid yellow and a double solid yellow...
5	Since they only do 6 a year now I would rather it be somone more exciting and surprising
2	[NAME] a bastard man
0	Yup, he's still one of the strongest turtles in the game though. Eventually you're gonna have to attack.
9	You basically already know the entire series for how much they've talked about it and how brazenly they spoil it.
8	This right here is the kind of father I want to be. Thanks for that.
19	Same.. If I'm particularly stressed out someone just walking down the same road as me feels like they're invading my space.

20	This picture is as old as Tinder. OP is probably a dog for all we know.
21	This report is going to be bullet proof
20	[NAME], 2020 OKC 1st, 2019 CLE 2nd For [NAME] and [NAME] A little filler required to get it done (possibly [NAME] or [NAME])

20	Didn't know they sell pro bowl jerseys.
9	I work on a farm. I can confirm can be dangerous. I have a hard time imagining a scenario where being a cop is more dangerous.
20	The staff there know what they're talking about whether or not you're making money, no matter how difficult will be huge. you are not alone.
1	It's funny cause OP is trying go against the mindset that most men are predators but in inadvertently reinforcing it :/ awkward.
11	Of course these are all conspiracy theory shitposts BUT just because he got squeezed out, doesn‚Äôt mean they want him playing for a rival team.
20	What does it matter we're just going to take another bust in the middle of the first round like always
21	I mean yeah but it still sucks. Hopefully you have better luck in the future.

20	There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.
20	"...starts Jan 1. ""Published Jan 2"" Way to hit that breaking news."

15	Yeah, I see you‚Äôre point. Thank you
21	Hope [NAME] is ok to play but if he needs to rest that hand then that's what he should do...
20	"I kinda expected [NAME] to be like""Oh he's good? Ok bye"""
20	And I call them alcoholics who can't hold a relationship together
4	Nah I think you're just feeling confident because you got a slamming deal on those clothes! I would feel the same way!
9	I'm terrible sorry, /u/bookluvr83, but I'm afraid I must join up with the giving-you-crap-for-not-liking-brownies bandwagon. ^kidding ^^^kinda
1	3:08am and my laughter has now turned into wheezing sobs
0	I don't know what would have happened had you tried to get past, but I'm glad you just noped the duck out of there.
23	Try taking the fillings of your sandwiches to the edges and maybe your kids would stop leaving the edges.
20	You are just tricking yourself.
9	Downvoted because I stated facts ok...
4	Actually good point, I should have asked for the source their too. It was only a rumor when I first heard. Might be wrong, sorry.
20	What a sad end for this franchise. I doubt Fallout 5 will redeem it at this point... what a damn shame
20	Tool fan from the U.S. here. Something seems off about this question. Cheers, mate!

0	They‚Äôre as good as tagged

5	Calm down. It's a real concept.
6	Is that why I didn't like the show? Am I too happy?
10	it's basically summer here right now. these posts are clueless.
20	They were talking about what they should call the 'not Constantinople' release in the meeting- its a crime that nobody thought of this.

20	They won't go after her, they LOVE [NAME]. 
20	Lmaoo the comment posted 14 hours ago gets doenvoted, but the same exact comment posted one hour ago gets upvoted. What??
20	That Facebook post was too loud.
5	At least you can skip it
2	You're not my real mom. I don't have to listen to you. Just because my dad loves you doesn't mean that I have to!

0	I just saw it on there... pretty cheap to be such a old item... starting bid on one was a $1
20	Looks eerily like the series of a guy who was unpacked on the street near Star Seeds last night.
11	Solid argument. Honestly this game‚Äôs a mess and impossible to balance for both sides equally.
10	Let's not pretend that all fetishes are fine.
14	[NAME] that is frightening...
20	It‚Äôs probably warmer in the freezer than it is outside. Oof
20	As I mentioned above I don't have the funds for that right now but as soon as I do I'll definitely be doing that
3	This must be what you get angry about when you don‚Äôt have any actual problems in your life.
10	"Saying ""no"" five-ten times then a reluctant ""yes"" to shut you up is not consent!"
20	Oh heck owo
4	I agree with your statement.
18	My favorite pairing now is [NAME] and [NAME]. There's nothing else good. Of course I Like [NAME] and [NAME] too but I miss [NAME] so much
20	She should have her medical license revoked because she took an oath to do no harm

23	Ah. I thought you meant ads in general. Sorry, bud! 
1	Wow. A relevant and amusing Garfield comic.
20	Also linked with [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] is virtually done.

9	1 is spot on. Anxiety completely disappears. I like when that happens. One less issue
15	Big thanks to OP for that magnificent wall. I guess that we can reopen the government now.

20	i think people are just getting more and more fed up with playing against him
23	I know, which is why I said it hasn't been referenced by any *living* characters on the show.
20	What's wrong with that? [NAME] scandal is funny but not something to focus on in 2020.

20	Oh sure, that makes it much easier to pay your bills with no money. The money will just come at some point in the future!

4	YES EXACTLY THANK YOU ...if only more lower and middle income voters understood this.
23	Honestly I realized they‚Äôre not really gatekeeping, but [NAME] last comment shows the gatekeeping

0	how the absolute fuck did black panther get nominated for best picture? its marvel action schlock at its worst. blackkklansman on the other hand is a great movie
7	As a guess: Didn't want to exit, but wasn't about to stay put after hitting another truck.
20	Imagine discovering time travel and you‚Äôre just like ‚Äúhi, im famous now‚Äù 
20	Yeah so I got kicked from a group chat for gnoming people*
20	IIT: man turned on by that and me trying to figure out how the fuck does she not gag?
0	Ik these are great!
9	>doesn't make a border wall ineffectual. As ineffectual as the TSA is, at least they can't be defeated by a simple ladder.
20	AA is BS as a whole. Meritocracy or GTFO.
13	It's super annoying. There is a reason I no longer speak to this person.
20	It's due to the fee we have to pay since we aren't buying an electrical company from Washington state.
18	I'm two weeks in, hope your right, I'm loving the game right now
20	I tried doing it but it‚Äôs hard when you‚Äôre Indecisive and always want to remake the characters design
3	I don‚Äôt *think* she‚Äôs awful, I know she‚Äôs awful. She has literally no redeeming qualities. 
4	Looks so surreal that i don't even feel anything looking at this.
18	I loved [NAME] so much
25	I see... that's a shame, but I guess we're comrades until it comes time for the 8th revolution or so
20	Oh hell yeah. The Don is perfect for when [NAME] rounds into the second half of his career after he‚Äôs collected a few rings.
4	You sure showed him buddy.
20	Because train hitting your truck at full speed will prevent damaging the truck.
20	I guess it‚Äôs no surprise that [NAME] really was [NAME] Destenay.
10	I‚Äôm a left-leaning libertarian, and it annoys me that the left won‚Äôt have an honest conversation on immigration and border security.
26	I‚Äôd go [NAME]. [NAME] gets raked on any mistake I throw personally
11	You are BOTH awful people.
4	You gotta use the footage that you got haha And yeah of course, my guy.
7	Wait so did you permanently lose sight in one eye or is this just temporary?
17	yeah, i believe thats the only moving part in the whole device.
6	Sksksksk omg, I think I must‚Äôve got confused then, yeh top for ep8 right? And that‚Äôs the makeover or the ball?

20	I'd say Sprite as chaser
25	She immediately regretted it when you reacted like an excited 3rd grader
20	Choking/strangulation is one of the strongest predictors of more severe future violence. Absolutely press charges and take whatever other steps you need to be safe.
3	Anyways. Weird behaviour of it when it was happening is that it hid itself when the video was paused then reappeared as the video continued.
20	Did they give you a warning first?
25	Then I‚Äôm sorry but this game really isn‚Äôt for you. Progression like that would ruin the base of what this game is.
20	I've just thrown all my spoons in the bin. I'll learn to eat yoghurt with a fork.
20	There is none, if anything pro government newspapers have been trying to show that its not the case in the last couple weeks. 
6	[NAME] has only missed a couple games and WCJ hasn't missed any. Not sure how you rank their top 4.

0	Min Gung in Glastonbury also has all you can eat sushi. Always a good time!

10	Thank you for responding with truth to a top comment that is intentionally very misleading
10	I didn't know [NAME] was a [NAME] Lord.

3	Ouh shittt my dad is also going to be surprised
18	I haven't seen it here yet, but I love LetterKenny. It gets funnier as the show goes on and it's on Hulu 
11	The guy is seriously neurotic.
20	There just shouldn't be police enforcing nonsense traffic laws. Cops should stay at their station until summoned by a citizen like fire trucks and ambulances do.
0	This is a good step. Refusing to vaccinate your kids should be considered child abuse.
8	Thank you very much for your time and advice! I‚Äôll consider it greatly for the future!
2	"I was quoting him. He wanted an ""outsider rich business type"", piss off"
6	I don't follow him but I don't see a problem if he wants to do that. Maybe he's just inquisitive.

0	That's so amazing! I am happy for you both!
2	It's not G A M E R time unless we get to berate women and minorities.

4	I'm so happy you said this. I just accepted that I was going crazy.

9	That fascist bigot!
3	Not this time

0	Great! I hope we can make our loan system work better
6	Don‚Äôt you guys want to get off with me?
0	Your amazing too!
4	I would have to imagine this girl has just been training super hard for the past few weeks.
1	I can see that. Ffs who the hell would expect a Dean to recognize 2 people out of 25,000 people lol.
10	Let's be honest here if [NAME] played last night the Canucks win. This defense is a major concern and needs a complete overhaul this offseason.
25	sorry. emotional writing bot! you dont know what its like to have an amygdala! lol
6	[NAME] royally fucked up that last rotation. Also did [NAME] even get a single kill with their specialists ?
11	You didn't come here to debate. You came here to excuse abhorrent behavior.
2	Kill whitey!
8	I am so sorry for your loss and all the stress you have right now. All the internet hugs you want right now! <3
20	Uhh have they really concreted those phone boxes shut?
3	Only [NAME] could claim that shutting down the thing he is in charge of is a success.
13	Here, here. Cheers to starting fresh!
4	Glad you answered your own question.
20	When are the Blackhawks going to play again games that matter? :(
20	It seems hazy, and there‚Äôs been conflicting messages
4	I agree. She's a terrible model. I tried to get on board with her, but all her editorials in Vogue were so flat. 
0	This is the sweetest thing ever, im gonna steal it and use it on my fiance
6	Why was the discrimination and ghettoization of [NAME] prior to their extermination legal? Because legislators sometimes don't care for morality.
3	I might be stupid but I thought [NAME] wore #16?
20	She doesn‚Äôt have to be added to the game for her to be significant, [NAME] was just an extreme example.
20	Whats up with the human race turning into invertebrates anyways?
5	Maybe one day you'll open yours and realise feminism helps everyone

20	PAC man looks too fast
20	That whole chart looks like something someone made up to post on incels.

20	"Ahhh, the old ""if you don't vote the way I do, you're a big dumb idiot"" gambit. "
20	#[NAME] camp is dying, price must be dropping now that NYY are out
9	I dunno how to read this yet. I guess it depends on how the other moves they make shake out.
14	It is 100% a scam. They've been copying many [NAME] with the same message.
21	Just imagine the waitstaff carrying cast-iron plates everywhere! oof!
24	So glad you left and didn‚Äôt just sit through the date with that idiot!
24	OOF, well if im dancing with someone i dont really look at their crotch so im pretty surd ur fine. How old are u
0	Thanks. Those are great suggestions.
20	[NAME] being 50-33 against winning teams kinda suggests it wouldn't matter that much if their division were better. Maybe have gone to 7 superbowls instead of 8.
12	I‚Äôm embarrassed how long it took for me to figure this out. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3	Aw poor kid. At least he has a bomb-ass name. Too bad he probably doesn't remember it anymore.
15	We welcome her with open arms.
2	Let this be a lesson at how easily manipulated some therapist are. Block the therapist immediately. He/she has been compromised by a psychopath.
27	I didn't know there was a name for that.
0	Most watched sport in the world lol
20	Then they are idiots.
10	> i have never even dated a girl. Lol
15	I once went alert on N1 and killed 3 people.. 2 maf and a doc. Doc got resurrected later thankfully
6	So the key to living is to do nothing?
4	Oh that also would have been good. Plus, breaking pottery is so satisfying
21	The only winner here is this guys future divorce lawyer.
17	I like this template, it makes me happy.
20	But they aren't blaming anyone other than the potential law breaking of other fisherman here. It's a straw man.
20	Looks like the next level of a horror character
15	Congrats! How long was the journey? Did you stick with [NAME] the entire time?
17	This. Nothing would make me happier than the see the gNats hamstrung for the next decade because they gave a ridiculous contract to a hometown hero.
20	They blew him? That's a hell of a deleted scene....
0	I thought you were just going to wait her out. You actually engineered her loss of space to someone else. WELL DONE!!!!
3	They‚Äôre probably fighting, that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs *really* getting out of the house for ‚Äúself care.‚Äù
15	That's along the lines of what I was thinking, thank you!
0	Shits me no end mate, good on you for doing something
1	Sonofabitch that makes it so much better [NAME] Edit: you talking about this?
26	[NAME] thats real? I'm so glad i unsubbed from pics

20	[NAME] has 6 eyes and will thus be the best actor in the movie
0	Free with a price of $600+ if you want full standard collection or maybe $300+ if you grind with no life. What a deal!
7	Im very interested. Contact me if you are going to set one up and want/need help.
21	>Shes completely self-made too :) Now I'm imagining her as some sort of entity that brings its own existence about
20	"""At least you're not this guy."""
14	No, that‚Äôs just another way of backing a coup. Sit back and wait. If either side is going too far then offer to help.
7	How often does this happen? To you and others? I'm curious.
24	Could be an attainability thing. My personality is very aloof and I tend to have much better results with more confident girls in general.
4	"[Licks salt] ""Hey guys, this *definitely* isn't snow!"""
20	Why would [NAME] retire when he still has 5 horcruxes left?
27	A surprise, but a welcome one
18	i love you.
0	MAKE A MORE DETAILED STORY OF THAT. ALSO MAKE UR OWN SUBREDDIT (r/amusementparkshenanigans). UR A GOOD STORYTELLER

4	We should have had a dman protecting the net on that play. Our future is Taco's
11	And yet, it‚Äôs bad to manipulate people. Which is what the in laws are doing. 
4	Also a lot of houses in the US might not have too many neighbours. It‚Äôs a lot more sparse out there
15	Sorry this shit is happening to you. Thanks for capturing the first [NAME] in WWII. Go Coast Guard.

14	I want to go scuba diving so bad, but swimming in anything bigger than a pool terrifies me.
4	I don't think the blame rests entirely with America (those woh joined the taliban still made a concerete choice) but no US forces are not innocent.
3	Yep, they expect you to revolve around them, but think they‚Äôre exempt from returning the favour. 
0	This is awesome! I really wish I could make it!

14	[NAME] is scared out there. Didnt want the ball
20	I will have nothing to do with this specter, who selectively appears to individuals and abandons others. No better than a cruel warlord.
17	This made my rainy day
20	She looks like her face is pulled back with ''face lifts'' tape. Or like she's pulling back her face like that scene in MIB I.
17	Happy Cake day.
2	It's good to see that the rich are being cured of this. :) As for the poor, we can just burn them for fuel.
20	Coincidence vs correlation vs causation
4	The same thing used to happen with Cowboy. We've been that team before.
20	Let's say for a moment that this was true. How does that get us the truth more often, and more reliably, than science?
19	Looks like any time there‚Äôs a huge spike in viewers, it‚Äôs a crossover. Legends sure has a really pathetic turn out.

23	I thought my [RELIGION] boarding school was weird but now it seems pretty tame and mild in comparison.

3	It is honestly just garbage, I'm surprised they're allowed to be ads

10	Oh weird, the money I make is taxed when I earn it and then it gets taxed when I spend it
4	Be strong. I've felt the same way before in my living situation. I hope things go your way, keep us updated!
20	at some point you just have to make some shots -[NAME]
20	AND MY AXE!
20	Nah, share it then down vote it in to oblivion.
5	Probably just do the job and try to work out your anxiety rather than taking the path of least resistance which offers no character growth. Best of luck
20	I find it unfortunate that you use gender-non-conformance as an insult.
11	That looks absolutely awful. On the good side, whoever made it, can only get better.
4	I would start laughing, screaming seems inappropriate

10	The joke doesn't even have anything to do with the song.

9	Everyone who is complicit in all this should be punished and questioned as to why they allowed this to happen. Complete disgrace!
20	Anything yet?

20	Glad that [NAME] continues to be himself even in a mystery fortress. I doubt I'll ever play another game as good.
20	I don‚Äôt know why, but if I had to guess his sport beforehand...I‚Äôd still say it‚Äôd be bowling

20	Well first, im against government period, and second im conveying this under a layer of satire to make the ideas spread more easily
4	[NAME] gonna end up killing her. Its just whether she does it willingly, regrettably or accidentally.
3	"At least he was polite - ""please"" fuck off! "
0	The intro in that video looks like a sand storm on there, imagine a sand storm while playing GA on that map, it would be awesome!
1	[NAME]. Yeah, right. Lol
23	As a 29 year old newly married man, I still do some cringey stuff from time to time. 
0	Smh. Can y‚Äôall stop being so hot? For real though congrats, you two look so happy together!
14	Shit, they don‚Äôt go down!? That blows 
20	Once the work has been done to certify the car, it cannot be undone. Easier to go the other way.

20	damn he took my diamonds and all my emeralds smh.
3	Damn so the Patriots are gonna get thielen after all
8	I want to wipe her entire face off the face of earth
0	I think it is worth documenting this sort of stuff, as a reminder. They'd do this to your kids too. In a heartbeat.
21	Because he only won it begrudgingly last year. No one likes watching him play. [NAME] will win it unless [NAME] scores 40+ points like every game.
20	Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt want to poop without my phone either. Gotta scroll reddit while I‚Äôm poopin!
26	Sadly, it was not
12	209 comments and we don‚Äôt get to read any? All that good pasta advice going to waste. Shame.
4	You shouldn't be using hydrocortisone on your face:
20	Now this is a Contrapoints video I want to see
1	Rofl this pysyk kid is a disgrace
20	It means France. [NAME] is a guy from Paris.
3	Your 'brother' had texted alot of girls and ended up on in Internet many times then, what a celebrity! Did everyone clap as well? 
10	My ETL been trying to tell us every box should take us 30 seconds max, and everyone ive asked about that has laughed and called it bullshit
20	I'd say it's at least a little ironic given that Artifact is modeled closely on the pricing model of MtG's cardboard edition.
20	[NAME] save us
1	Similarly to how they all claim to never read it but they're always reacting to what's said in the comments lol
24	Woof thank goddddd I changed my flair

12	Man, [NAME]. What a shame that trainwreck turned out to be. 
5	I'm with you. I'd like one too.
7	Is that for hazmat? And thanks broüëä
0	my favourite depictions of [NAME] and the gang are the ones where [NAME] is stoic and sassy and [NAME] and [NAME] are super emotional goofballs
26	True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams.
20	FYI not all skinheads are racists. [NAME] suck and should be confronted.
4	No worries! üòä
3	I didn't say remain was left wing. I said the E.U acts as a buffer against the most insane and cruel Tory policies.
3	My feelings exactly. First thought, a sarcastic 'Thanks.'
13	"Needs another ""hockey feels hard at the moment"" and a game against Dallas after that."
18	I'd love that

20	Feb ‚Äò06 [NAME] But your point stands
4	A little weird but I guess it's wholesome.

7	When did we get rid of uprights? He was amazing for us?
15	Different color for different people, please and thank you.
3	Bishop [NAME] was talking about lawmakers rather than the women who seek abortions. Though the situation doesn't matter when it comes to dismembering a baby.
20	Im also a young adult, >18 <25 if that helps
25	I apologize for doubting you.
0	[NAME] is letting [NAME] play 3 :0. That is good news.
0	Honestly, I love hearing about stories like this - like the multitude of Skyrim and Oblivion mod developers who eventually got hired by studios due to their work.
3	[NAME], beer me the strength to make this price lower!
0	That‚Äôs actually a great idea. I didn‚Äôt even think of that.
3	One of my coworkers at my old job used to get a venti hot white mocha with 20 packets of sugar stirred inüò∑
5	Good for you.
20	There was a commercial about men encouraging other men not to perpetuate toxic masculinity. Of course the Republicans felt it was condescending and anti-men.
18	Yes. It feels sharp and hurts in the chest sometimes. It will pass, but it freaking sucks. I'm here to listen, if you want‚ù§
20	Dont keep your mouth shut.
3	That doesn't sound right but I don't know enough about stars to dispute it
13	I don't blame you, this sub makes me feel crazy on a daily basis. 
8	I wish I could go, but I can‚Äôt. Do enjoy your time and I pray it is spiritually fruitful for you!

20	Thought this was about signing brown. Op is an attention whore
0	[NAME] speed!
0	Man, what a great post Edit: wow! Thanks for the kind, gold stranger!
6	Indian/East Asian?
20	Gee...what a guy...
20	Your an idiot and trying to justify your ignorance.
21	Unless you're a conservative trying to protect yourself. In that case, good luck.
19	The Rockets, too. This month will be a horror show.
0	All women are useless - maybe if you made better choices it would be better for ya
0	Try really warm water instead. It's awesome.
4	I'm new here from the U.S. This convo cleared it up for me, so thanks.
9	There‚Äôs NO WAY that car is worth 25k - walk away.
11	Whoa this is really creepy
6	Wow sold out during break without most of the students. Don't know how they'll fit the students in once we're back
20	You've shifted the goalposts from first novel to first modern novel... You people always complain that incels don't provide any support for their claims.
20	Removing republicans is the first step. You can scream about how they are the same, but perhaps you should look at voting history. Good luck. 
0	I used to like [NAME] so much him and [NAME] were one of my fave couples but I‚Äôm over him and his BS lol
10	It‚Äôs probably down to low player base.
18	We still luv u
20	Also there's better ways we can spend taxpayer dollars than on another election.
9	I didnt see a ref's hand up, I was about to have a stroke
5	Say that you like her

0	That's the theme of this excellent play:
6	mayhaps (I do not know what you mean)
0	Props to the guy for being honest
10	this isnt really wholesome? he probably shot any gender of deer and didnt think twice about hunting does
20	This is so true yet they usually dont listen.
4	Exactly. And they parade around with their protruding stomachs as if they're [NAME] gift to the world. *barf*
3	That, plus they also store our info insecurely so it leaks out. Just another part of this dumb economics game I guess...
20	The rest of the starting QBs.
4	it's also impolite to talk on the train
5	As long as you do the cooking by the book üòè
20	It's in the news. I think I read it in SFgate or maybe mercury news.
7	That‚Äôs a shame. What‚Äôs worse, evangelicalism or Scientology? Tough call
17	Correct. I just enjoy debating them.
7	I like you, do you like me? Please circle Yes No
17	Happy little lies.
27	I was honestly shocked when they denied an overpayment, especially since after the charges cleared it would have been a $0 balance.
7	Wait, what was [NAME] doing?
20	This post is amazing. Definitely starting to see good days and life just kept improving after my Nex. Thank you for this
15	Yeah I had android and was having difficulties but I was able to get it easily when using my gf's mac. Thanks!
20	This kinda looks like something shot in the style of Reno 911. Especially the bit where the cops look back and simultaneously say ‚ÄúJaywalking!‚Äù
2	You're a freak, you dirty dog you.
20	Probably one everytime I run out of the $1 million, 97% success rate? Worth the risk 
10	YOUR momentum doesn't help you, its the direction you're aiming and THEIR momentum that does. they were probably backing up when that happened.
9	I did too. A shame, because it looks to be a good movie otherwise.
26	I lost a six pack this way once. For a good year every traffic stop became a field sobriety test.
20	Just put it on your penis soft and then you will grow into it
19	Get her professional help.
14	This is a terrible idea
14	*Dread it, run from it* *[NAME] still arrives*
20	WHERE THR HECK IS VOL'JIN AND MY TROLL EMPIRE, YEARS HAVE PASSED WE HAVE 2 PANDA AND STILL ONE TROLL
20	Then keep your hands visible and fight the ticket in court. Don‚Äôt understand how this is such a complex issue.
13	That was amazing!
15	I'm just glad I've never heard of this game before otherwise this news would be disappointing.
20	Curious about your thoughts on BC‚Äôs LNG activity.
1	Lmao I‚Äôm so sorry but yet intrigued as to how it contributed to your breakup?
20	here for me scenes of [NAME] being dragged by her children
20	I think you're probably a shite irl.
21	I'll pass.
14	We had a clown banging on dorm windows, on campus, with a knife in 2016. Was terrifying. 
20	If you enjoyed it, go for it.
18	I can be convinced to like any trade right now but it all comes down to the return.
6	I‚Äôm confused because her mom doesn‚Äôt post anything bad, especially compared to her photos she took in prison. 
20	They're basically our version of [NAME] and [NAME] at this point. Every video seems to involve a dumbass rant that misses the point of the topic.
4	Wrote some good poems too
4	An other skier that wasn't injured I guess
13	Bruh cake happy day
20	we're ok buddy!
7	Did you taste it
6	I guess he exploded because he went below 50 mph.
27	And the apartment is clean! You can see the floor!
7	Enjoying oneself automatically makes an action harmless?
8	Totally. I'd be happy if they put the food directly into my hands.
20	The pit! I fell in it, the pit! You fell into the pit! We all fell into the pi-ee-ii-ee-iit!
10	No it‚Äôs true. However it is time to rethink how we recycle clothing in cities and the elimination of donation bins is step one.

6	Wouldn't it be easier to find 10% then multiply by 2?

20	S. we're just visitors in the twilight zone, a different time and space dimension, do do do do.
7	If she loves the place she‚Äôs at why leave? There‚Äôs something to be said for that. Idk your all‚Äôs financial situation tho
0	That looks like an expensive hobby.
7	Why is this being downvoted lol?

20	>would of ......
20	The real joke is your grades dude
20	‚ÄúI got five on it‚Äù for the movie US is decent as well. They made it so creepy.
10	No offense, but you are jumping in conclusions that may be as incorrect as blaming [NAME]. 
20	But the last scene I saw was just [NAME] bringing the kid to her no talk of leaving was there a scene where [NAME] reconciles with [NAME]
4	This is exactly what I‚Äôve been thinking!
9	He didn't see him and afterwards tried to high five him but [NAME] was walking away

8	Theres no clonazolam in that bottle that vendor sends bunk shit. Im considering suing that vendor for scamming me
3	From the South and can confirm that [NAME] is an idiot and should be saying brink.
15	I was wrong about that one part. I've edited my comment to reflect my mistake. Thanks for posting the relevant bit of the bill.
3	I‚Äôm sorry, you just sound like one of those people who takes overwatch super seriously and has no life
17	Let's hope that they don't miss, huh?
20	No like its legit cgi Edit: this comment has some value the entire thread has things to pick apart in it
12	Super weird question. Not really commenting either way, just so weird the life we have created for modern humans.
20	I know of two people who did the Keto and some intermittent eating and got off all meds.
20	Yes but my point is [NAME] raping [NAME] makes more sense if she gives birth to [NAME] and [NAME], not [NAME].
20	The old bait and switch.
5	Being rich isnt the only way to be successful. The first success to conquer is learning to love and accept ourselves
20	Having said that, if it was me there instead of you I probably wouldn't have come up with that until 20 minutes after the altercation was over.
3	What makes it a non sequitur? The point is, just because someone is in the DSA doesn't mean they are a *democratic* socialist
6	I actually don't remember the last time I applied sunscreen to any part of my body
20	You didn't watch it to the end.
20	The comic relief of the cat world - when they‚Äôre not tearing the flesh from your bones
4	You have great points. !delta
0	This thread is loaded. Never seen so many coins exchanged at once :) it's nice to see friendly internet interactions.
3	What kind of source has that info but not enough to say what would come back in trade? Meh... I'll ignore this one.
2	8 years ago a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of a friend very seriously said we should nuke Compton. One guess who is a rabid [NAME] supporter now.
13	Well fuck. Just glad to get the point outta that
10	No, we should increase border security because we have an absurd number of people crossing illegally.
15	Thanks man, words give me strength
20	Awful taste hmmmmm
7	[NAME] damn it, dude. Are you trying to ensure every gun owner in PA votes red? Because that's how you do that. 
2	I still hated the system though. I felt penalized for using anything that wasn't the power beam the entire game.
9	1k followers on Twitter. Seem to have no sponsors. Not looking good

20	it really do be like that sometimes
3	As if they're going to go through that much effort... they wont even walk up the stairs to get to the box
8	I don't particularly want an Eagles repeat either. Chargers, Colts or Chiefs would make me feel best. Then Rams and Saints.
2	Are you being stupid again?
4	Yeah, my schedule has been brutal for the past 2-3 years. This year it has become my objective to get more involved to get-in with more parents.
15	Thank you for your service o7

3	"TTs have size limits. The group I was acquainted with had, ahem, ""leadership"" problems as well."
1	I laughed but unfortunately [NAME] is our problem because of how close Canada and USA relations are.
6	You do not get my math? Because my comment and your comment are saying the same thing; women over 45 probably do not want bio kids.
26	I'm sorry. That's awful
0	I think he can be much, much better than [NAME]. No doubt. His length, good defense. We are talking about [NAME], right?
23	All that shows is them loaning money when Liverpool make losses, which seems to have happened more than any of us realised. We don't make a loss
4	I agree üòä
2	Can you stop living with this person? Engaging in it will only make it more toxic
13	Imagine that rattle.. all the way back to Michigan. Enough to drive you mad
17	[NAME] has been playing pretty nice since he's been freed from dnps
6	I wonder if this will ever appear on BotW. Since it's so straightforward there probably isn't much to talk about.
7	Would love to have him come back to the organization in some way. GOAT.
1	Lmao y'all are in for a real rude awakening with [NAME] if y'all thought *those* were soft.
15	Oh ok! Thanks for the info.And oh [NAME] I can‚Äôt imagine what that would feel like
11	What a bizarre way to normalize the psychological path to becoming a violent criminal.
20	Omgsh. What‚Äôs bad is if you look at her two years ago she looks normal and just beautiful and then it progressively gets scary
19	Stop doing weird things
6	How did you try it if it's not live yet? There was no early access to it
4	Doesnt the bible have lovely passages about stoning hereticals as well? Moderate [NAME] are probably more common than you think.
18	I love how you worded this comment. It's like a proverb.
10	Didn't realize they were shipping the challenge coins with Israeli FAL rifles, that makes this whole thing even weirder.
18	Love the use of ginormous ... so true
20	Ahhh, a DM Of The Rings fan I see!
0	Thanks for being a brave troop, comrade. [NAME] annoys the shit out of me too.
3	It's almost like people live in this bubble where there are only magatards and hillshills. No inbetween. Only hyperpolarization.
14	Miami is supposed to have beautiful people, but these camera shots of the crowd sure as hell aren't showing them.
3	Idk which is worse. The guy doing the project or me watching the video.
21	I guess the trick is not to eliminate susceptibility to 51% but to minimize it extremely.
9	Great story, but I'm on PC and didn't get a chance to play ;c.
0	I‚Äôm glad things are coming to light, I pray justice is served for the victims. 
20	I just don't think [NAME] is the guy to do something like this.
20	Dude, calm down. Even a freshly arrived transplant can share in mourning the loss of a business that‚Äôs been there multiple decades.
6	Yeah, even though I give it to him that it was confusing that they designed Crysis 1 for PCs that wouldn't come out for like 5 years.
4	This hits hard, sadly both of my relationships have been toxic so I've decided not to start any new ones until I start going to uni 
11	It‚Äôs like you didn‚Äôt even read the comment you‚Äôre responding to.

3	You said an untrue thing. Own up to it, asshole.
4	Dude looks like a lady
20	Society has once again falsely made men look cold and emotionless. You're normal.
14	The left side attack of [NAME] [NAME] was woeful

14	Seriously Creepy.

26	I literally cried out IS THAT MATT BERRY?!?!?!?!?!

13	That lady is experiencing pure joy
1	I don't think you see it in the flames sub... if you do it's probably a joke

23	I live in Northern Scandinavia now and one of the biggest culture shocks to my American brain was the groups of very young kids just roaming the neighborhood.
27	Surprisingly, not a lot of people know though.

21	I just hope the show brings [NAME] back because she was really great.

0	Looks like a pretty good plate overall!!
11	‚ÄúI am going to be going through a nasty divorce in a few years so I will need the money.‚Äù - [NAME]
6	Did he say skinny wieners?

6	Oh. It really is [RELIGION]. I was wondering if that was a bad gag.
0	Not at all! It‚Äôs my pleasure
12	I thought he was trolling oops

20	I wanna see [NAME] get in [NAME] face like this
10	[NAME] yer fucked.
5	i luckily became really good friends with one. we definitely helped each other process our pain from him... so surreal how well they spin those lies

20	[NAME] dropped his career high on them last season.
3	I accidentally swiped. I don't have time right now I swiped for ego and got it so I don't actually want to talk to anyone.
10	Yep. That whole second kid thing is no joke.... Soon this will be a distant memory. That‚Äôs what I tell myself
0	That was so damn cute. She looks just like [NAME] and I bet it just melts his heart to see how mature that girl is
6	Welp....I think your question came across as judgmental. Why did you ask it?
4	you can't damage anything other than on foot players right now, no turrets, no vehicles, no objectives, it has been bugged since the december update
1	I feel like I have to call bs on this one. I hope lol

0	that's really good
0	It's the best, I haven't been so happy in a long time!

4	Bench coming in strong. Let's go trey!

15	Yeah I think I‚Äôll just wait until things are more sure. Thanks so much!
20	I feel the same on [NAME]. She's trying too hard to be hard-hitting etc. Thought she was poor on Thursday.

5	Hi, [NAME]! I am here to offer you a robot hug, and to wish you the best day of your life! -HappyFriendlyBot
20	this is retarded
3	He's being so unprofessional. He's out for blood for some reason.
13	It'll be the first game of the day!
12	Yep. Let him know. Weird awkward NOPE is better done online than in person
9	I didn't hear anything, somebody sent me this.
11	Damn, I want some!

7	Who is this?
22	Inspiring music that makes you proud.
1	Jajaja (hahaha)
4	Very light onset compared to the Pharma 10s I had past year. Arrived ND though so no regrets.
10	You see that's why you don't give tuna and catnip to the neighborhood cats because then they'll never leave.
20	Daily Wire is a hate site, and [NAME] is a bigot.
15	I love those examples. Thank you for sharing. üôè
20	Off her meds
13	I had big plans in life when I met this guy and two years later, nothing has materialized. Yes, I also feel frozen in time. 
20	I need a do over!!!! At least I‚Äôm not the only one lol, solidarity ‚úåÔ∏è
25	Bet Highland Council are sorry they sold their bunker last year.
20	We can work on both. Ignore centrists who want to pretend that we have to choose.
3	I used to work with a guy that was always whining how tough his life was. My family this, my friends that. Very annoying
21	She had the glory of being a virgin martyr. Eternal glory is hers.
0	You good.
9	I put so much thought into things that often I trigger myself unintentionally. I can be hurt before something has a chance to happen.
6	I think this is very relevant, u/lilhan2
20	When [NAME] like ‚Äúshould we have an alien baby‚Äù and [NAME] looked SO happy üòÇüíõ
20	But it is! People totally shame you for only wanting one!
15	Might do that, thank you!

7	Messages like this will always get replies from me, even if it had been about erm punching me?!
9	I'm sorry but I would've have pressed charges on the guy who kicked me in the ribs while I was being held down.
20	Looks like Russian agitprop is pivoting to Tulsi. [NAME] can kiss his chances for 2020 goodbye.
7	How is it the worst though? Me and my friends all use it and love it (since 2016)
26	They are all secretly projecting their own cheating onto us. Emotionally stunted 5 year olds with zero impulse control will do that.
5	I'm on your side with this one. At least you have some legs to stand on.
20	"Whatever conclusion they reach now or in the future, the only constant will be that ""nothing should be done to stop it."""
20	Air Vooch oh my!

14	1 is the lie. I'm cheating because I remember this convo from last week.
3	By pushing misleading and false information, your agenda is dividing [NAME].
25	I killed them for the first time in my most recent playthrough and regretted it. The replacement council sucks just as hard.
20	No I‚Äôm just following your logic. To avoid pain people should die. Life is pain so people in pain should die. It‚Äôs your exact logic
20	I imagine that 50 years ago that's exactly the position he would take
19	He has made threats saying if he sees me on the street he will attack me that‚Äôs what the situation boiled down to
25	This used to be a lot more common when I was younger. So weird.
9	But but r/49ers said it was just bad luck!
20	[NAME]? For real?
20	Misleading title, his administration cut all programs using fetal tissue, not HIV stuff specifically. Still sucks though.
3	Who said anyone was white or black? Forget it, trumpie. You clowns don‚Äôt care about the truth. 
4	At least there‚Äôs still more likes than dislikes
19	You are gone right now probably my trip is just kicking in i took half that amount lol cuz im low you are having a hell of a ride rn
4	Just because some people troll him on Twitter and get literally no retweets or interactions, he'll surely change his way of directing...
20	Love me some incel gammer rage, pure gold
20	Show them your hymen
20	WHY IS THERE WOMAN ON MY ENTERTAINMENT??????????
3	And we know how [NAME] ended. [NAME] should run away like now.
20	>This erotic art from a borderline fan. FTFY
17	"I am glad I found this subreddit ""gatekepping"" is a phenomenon vocab btw."
20	I needed to hear this. I'm resigning my good paying FT soul sucking job to try something new. Wish me luck!
0	This is gross and sweet at the same time. Great parenting.
23	There is no such Thing as [NAME] or an Almighty !
0	One of my coworkers made the wait list. Great guy, but yeah, it is a rich getting richer situation.

0	3 under 3?! You are a true hero.
20	Those are separate issues from the sample size.

1	Dudes karma is -99 lol
12	heh, I remember that commercial.. Was pretty cringy
1	Proof of [NAME] love for mankind, beer and dogs. Love both and abuse neither.
17	Stargazing with Vi is definitely my favorite moment of the season so far
3	I feel that way about [NAME] antis saying [NAME] and [NAME] antis saying [NAME]. But I‚Äôm also terrible and laugh every time I see it.
20	His mind is free of anxiety he is now able to concentrate
3	This is one of the new accounts that tried to call me a cunt!
23	Just so you know the reason opponents were few in the 2018 election is because the opposition boycotted
10	It doesn‚Äôt look cool
2	*me Doesn't make any sense if your anxiety is afraid of these things, since it would be scared and go away then. 
6	Maybe a parsing or comprehension issue, but are you sitting in the water after you pee in it?
19	Those are literally the only possibilities.
0	Yeah, I read that the first time. Nobody is forcing you, other than yourself.
4	Sorry it was late at night. I fixed it.
6	Can we ban this person? Post history is sketch. Thanks in advance!
17	My relationship ended the first morning of 2019...Crazy way to start the New Year
20	Bruh by isn‚Äôt [NAME]
4	Don't feel guilty. If you don't leave it will be continuing the cycle of abuse for your children.
15	Thanks so much for the precious advice, that is very helpful!
15	I had forgotten, now I changed it, thank you very much for warning me about that! so sorry üôè
20	Hence a law is needed. Heck, they passed a law to stop telemarketers because they were annoying! Time to do it for TV!!
15	This post made me howl in laughter in the handicapped bathroom, thank you /u/coffeewhore17
5	2-4 minutes is not enough time to wash long hair. 10-15 minutes minimum. Stay strong!
10	He's got multiple head coaching interviews, so it's a very small likelihood he'd be available. I'm not crazy about him anyway.
20	It's actually just the [NAME] they hate. [NAME] is just their current object of scorn
20	I wonder what number he'll wear since he can't wear 20.
7	I‚Äôd be interested in reading more about this if you have a good place for me to do so. Thanks.
23	True but I am a fan of [NAME] and I'm just relieved he pulled through even if his victory did not make me any richer.
11	dude people here can be assholes. there‚Äôs nothing wrong with taking a break.
0	I don't know what you are about, but I love your enthusiasm.
20	If they didn't want the wheels to be stolen, they shouldn't have made then so easily stealable!
2	> The porn that I downloaded was Brazzers produced. In case you don't know, Brazzers is ***anal*** about their IP. Ha get fucked.
0	That can be a perfect gift for a [NAME]. Amazing work !!
18	That's my favorite type of plane.
9	"It's more like ""Get tinder or any of the apps and get rejected hundreds of times a day"""
20	Uncle [NAME] doesn‚Äôt deserve this
5	If yous got a problem with Canadian Gooses than you‚Äôve got a problem with me and i suggest you let that one marinate
10	No chance unless he smokes out of a gas mask or suffers a bad injury.
20	Meow-meow smiles upon all of this.
0	I don‚Äôt think anyone on this show has ever joined a sport for exercise. [NAME] is awesome!!!
6	Wait his nostrils are plugged? Isn‚Äôt that the opposite of breathing?
4	she'd probably do this
20	Yes... you little crybabies call them fascist too? People who kill fascists are fascists right?
6	Maybe go to the gym and lay off the tendies?
4	Why yes that ass is flawless
18	It would do us ALL a great deal of good.
0	Beautiful!!
20	There is no greater form of oppression than being called a bigot. #debateme #babyhitler #otherpeoplesbabies

27	me too! a guy a few posts up as well... I wonder how many of us we need for a class action lawsuit
1	I'm pretty sure you killed me. I got killed by a pounder on a plane on that very same map 2 days ago or so lol
3	Thank you for being the only person here to choose, not to be offended. This is a good burn. 
1	Thank you :) I was starting to seriously wonder if something was majorly wrong with my maternal instincts haha
4	I'm betting you're 100% right. üòäüçª
20	And the Reds. I subbed over at r/Reds after [NAME] went over there and their excitement at things actually happening fills me with envy
2	Because people that comment on YouTube videos are toxic, filthy heathens.
9	[NAME] had some pretty harsh words.
3	Unfortunately, on the stupid official Reddit mobile app it doesn‚Äôt work. I miss my Android and Reddit Is Fun app
26	Me thinks this crosses the line of dignity. Makes me sad. It‚Äôs one thing to expose things but another to mock it.
0	I liked the slug :(
3	Avoid Blount St and Martin Luthur King or risk death. I‚Äôm not kidding.
10	unplanned pregnancy != rape Not commenting on the beings involved in the story up above, but seriously those two things are not equivalent

20	this is one of those mt lebo residents y'all were railing on the other day
0	I think teams will still cut the cross-seam that made [NAME] and [NAME] so deadly last year. This is awesome nonetheless.
3	Nah, they're a fraction as immature and petulant as the politician we can't ignore that actually affects our lives.
20	For what...
7	Really? How would they know what pharmacy you want to visit?
14	Beyond nightmare!!
4	I understand the confusion
20	In many circles this would be considered a steal
20	Trolls are okay in this sub but let's be more serious here
0	Sounds like you have a great doctor. Most are scared to give you any sort of advice like that.
20	I clearly did mean she was being held back by SHD. Thanks for pointing it out! I guess that was missed (?)
6	Haven't printed a retraction in twenty years!
17	I am very happy with play music. please tell me this is a lie
0	You sir are a true hero.
7	That‚Äôs always what I thought as well, but isn‚Äôt that essentially being transphobic, etc? 
7	Is it weird that I‚Äôm relieved?
5	Then getafe should have gotten their first goal. Ref is really bad.
4	those pictures of [NAME] are real, he's on Crashing and the way he looked in the premiere was just awful.
18	I like [NAME], just thought there was significant savings there, and maybe sign [NAME] for cheaper...idk
3	It's about fucking time, hope this is real.
18	I love how it stops just before the impact
2	too damn often!! and i‚Äôm cute as hell! i‚Äôm mad!!

3	No, just dont show off your books. 
2	>!Cosplayer Bystander!<: I always knew he was a little bitch.
18	**I LOVE YOU!!!!** *[NAME] has unfollowed you.* ...oh.
20	Cat call girls on thebstreet, but get pissed when its done to his sister.
4	So now it‚Äôs a habit to live in a country without a running government I guess!
11	It‚Äôs really hard to watch for some people because of how awkward and... just how stupid [NAME] is in this episode
0	Cadbury is better than both of these, however they‚Äôre still solid choices.
20	I remember [NAME] mentioning [NAME] and that was it. I do remember all the [NAME] hype.

19	Buddy I think you may have been wooooshed..
4	And that's not [NAME] either. It's former HS o-lineman who now runs a frat
14	Bad execution but it made me smile through the cringe. The sentiment is definitely relatable.
11	That's not true. There are people that genuinely want to cause harm to people and don't care about reactions.
20	yep, its still time based so 1st will be absolutely raking it in 
24	Yes. Exactly. Anything non [NAME] belongs in the trash. Glad you agree.
20	Probably, but I'm also fairly certain it's easier for a [NAME] to get in than an [NAME] or a [NAME].
2	Because it's so ridiculously stupid people just can't help themselves.
2	I am getting a lot of weird replies...
20	* hugs you * there you go bro.
1	This made me laugh way harder than it should have
20	Those are literally gremlins when you realize the orange aren't their eyes.
20	It's fairly modern.. It opened in 2007.
24	Those cards are so cool
7	Is [NAME] gonna die to a bucket of water at the end of the series?
20	I was kinda just silent the whole time, we haven't spoken since. 
25	In 5 days bones would not be crusted over,sorry not buying it.
9	I have 1200 hours and the highest i‚Äôve ever been was silver elite. I should probably quit this game.
20	And this is why men are so against #believewoman
2	Sir the fuck down. This is an intervention, we need to talk.
10	i swear i've seen this on a poster somewhere at my school, it's awful

1	That would be fun
4	And yes I also thought [NAME] was someone else too!

20	They most likely did, since they still having bank issues.
2	I cannot believe the fucking audacity of him. Have some shame for [NAME] sake.
20	You can see [NAME] weapon on the plane in the background when [NAME] is talking
3	You really shouldn‚Äôt just pat wolves you know...
11	ooooooo...yikes
3	The worst thing about this tweet is how many likes and retweets it got
20	You just need to ignore him. He only crawls out when he can complain about traditional [NAME] or dem stupid republicans.

20	Arrg. I never should have let my mother in via SMS. At least it's only SMS.
20	You're a turd
20	I can't tell if this is satire of not. It's got this whole [NAME] and [NAME] dad rock vibe going on.
20	I suppose when discussing socialism one ought to avoid the use of the word prosperity, it does become a touch embarrassing.

15	Thank you for your feedback, I was just trying to tell you my reasoning behind it sorry if I came off as angry.

13	That's ma'am!
18	Wow I‚Äôve never seen that one and I love it! Could you share the picture?
1	Lol you're so close to getting it, dude. So close. 
3	Your ‚Äú[NAME]‚Äù is a train wreck at social media. Only skill he‚Äôs shown so far

20	"Yeah the only ""compromise"" is get married ASAP so you can have sex again (which is a HORRIBLE idea)."
10	No, he said he's bringing in somewhere around 10K a month, not 2500 a month. That's a HUGE income gap.
2	Looks like one of mine too. Such a horribly raised entitled rude brat

3	When I was her age I had 3 jobs... oh you have like 18... get off my lawn!

15	Wow. Thanks for this.
11	I mean it sucks but that man looks deaded
11	[NAME] doesn't seem to have based this on anything. The owner of the nightclub says there was no altercation at
23	My wife is not allowed to flick my ears for any reason, and apparently I'm not allowed to stick my finger into her bellybutton lmao.
20	At that point you might as well pay a visit to his home instead of suing. His house is a google search away.
1	"Well, actually it is a joke on how mansplainers often start their mansplaining with: ""well, actually""."
20	Our [NAME] is going off bro. [NAME] is gonna out-Jack you off.
7	The fact she'd want her daughter with someone as awful as [NAME] is strange. And what's wrong with [NAME] that she would stay with him ?
4	Correct but Reddit won't admit that as the reason.
20	Nice try Tyler 1
20	Just thought it was a clever title, no revenge really
3	Not loving what I'm seeing so far, let's hope we can tighten it up.

23	Drives to work, realizes its a holiday because nobody answers their phones. Still stuck at work... nothing to do. We dont get paid holidays :(
20	I heard not too long ago that they had homophobic ads too. They also play multiple ads through a 10 minute video which irritates me.
20	The ID cards wouldn't have been a problem if they were like the EU one. It was the fuckload of biometric data that was abhorrent.
7	So, a kid?
18	I like my coons too
20	Now, could you please turn the card around and show me those wacky three numbers on the back. 
11	its not even illegal for like siblings and parents/children to have sex as long as they are adults and consenting when the relationship begins.
20	Shouldn‚Äôt have told them how much they cost, as they advised they knew they were expensive and that it was ok. 
20	What limits are you talking about? Last time i checked, [NAME] doesnt have any limits
8	It's also my 40th birthday, so bring a gift! 
17	Today's Recaptchas were fun. I'm very good at identifying store fronts, apparently...

4	Well, since everything in Australia wants to kill you, I'd say it is quite healthy to be afraid of Australian spiders, and other flora and fauna 
20	I've been out of the country for the past week, has [NAME] stopped sitting on the fence and stated support for remain in that time?
0	Hey, I get your point of view. I appreciate the explanation. :)
3	the game certainly feels unfinished, at least on PC. some horrible mouse controls, using a controller is almost necessary.

20	Shut up, or you'll be tossed off the roof!
0	Wow great video. I love her.

20	It's impossible for communism to exist without a state.
4	The only clown that make me laugh.
5	When someone is that crazy, it's probably best to deescalate and go about your day rather than risk them doing something truly crazy. 
20	Now that you live alone you don't have money left to buy a dishwasher
0	Thanks I will try to delete the multiples. Good luck on everything.
7	And why would I do that? Edit: Thanks for setting up that Walder Frey line for me

2	Yeah but they actully had/have shit to be mad about. Their board is incapable.
17	I need more videos of this cat, love its face xD
23	[NAME] not calling anything so far. Means they will call everything second half. It‚Äôs inevitable.
0	[NAME] is so goddamn good
20	Input: Drink candle. NPC: You don't want to get wax in your mouth, do you? Input: Maybe I do, NPC.

20	Weren't the first set of reworks called updated movesets and major balance changes?
3	Tbh if they were hopped up on drugs and harassing employees and customers alike, I would have just called the fuzz anonymously.
0	I haven‚Äôt seen the episode yet but wow, what a reach.
10	Same. Not being hateful to the op but I don't see the connection.
3	As far as I know, she offered quick snack to all of them, just out of obligation and two of them accepted that.

0	That kill was beautiful
20	[NAME] left too early.
0	Oh good point! I bet the farthest they go is reporting to credit agencies. Which still sucks but he can always fight that outside of court.
4	They will. The White House gave credit yeste day to Russia and Syria and saod they will finish the fight against ISIL.
15	Hey, thanks! :)
20	That makes sense with NBC owning coverage of the Olympics.
4	Consider yourself one of the lucky ones. A. no attorney fees B. safe to say you‚Äôre dodging a bullet.

6	Why did no one check [NAME] for her comments though?
0	nah he only had one good year really

26	so painful to watch
3	Too bad no crossprog with PS4 thanks to Sony, though I heard gamedevs are trying to talk it out with them
4	you can bring all your cards to the game
3	What rights do men have that women don't in the west? Damn.
0	I'm so effin' proud of you! You handled it beautifully!

20	Seriously!? Wouldn't a guy do the same thing if a girl didn't even attempt to get him off?

9	Being a bronco fan in NY, this podcast is the only radio I can consistently get
4	I never said anything. I‚Äôm just cynical that change can happen when there is so much money on the line. Decisions are bought not made.
10	Nobody likes you
8	This is why bars should have poly nights. It would be nice to be in a room of like minded people, maybe they will talk to me.
3	"Reply with ""Oh, my bad"". Don't make a big fuss out of it. People make mistakes."
7	I am curious how much he will get
13	I like Simmonds, but I feel like he will command to highball price to pay for someone who will sit on the 3rd line.

10	I'd say more r/trashy than r/insanepeoplefacebook in my opinion
4	You‚Äôre so right. I‚Äôm just overthink it. But do you think it‚Äôs better in person or text?
21	When you stop making garbage takes, I'll stop correcting them
0	[NAME] is so good at drafting too, but he just struggles as a head coach. I‚Äôd be ok with this 
12	I was already over the edge with [NAME]. Just showing my disdain for two terrible individuals.
26	Ik I‚Äôm crying rn
0	that‚Äôs beautiful. are you sure it‚Äôs only twelve feet though? it seems much taller
10	Not a deal breaker for me. But it depends on a lot of factors. How and when she takes it and so?
27	Im just glad it didn't take any of that for us. I'm glad I didn't have to see a [NAME] screaming match
20	W'all miss Ramadan bro. Maybe you can fast on Monday and Thursday as sunnah.
20	I like him a lot but I assume he would be a prime piece in any trade for a LD.
5	Being scratched by a cat is not self harming
20	Man I just stick them on straight away. Don't really care if I get some type of infectious rash.
4	Thank you! I agree. We‚Äôve decided to back off. No need in feeding into it. :-)
1	Which one? I like their podcast but I can totally see why a lot of people wouldn‚Äôt hahaha
18	My girlfriend and I watch it all the time and love making love while it‚Äôs playing in the background!
7	Are 3.0 still active? I was really hoping they would have gotten signed after their tryout camp a couple years back.
1	Fellow [NAME] fan, reporting in. She's my favorite character in the series lol. 
20	It can be safely backdodged in duels because of its lackluster tracking. Avoids feint to gb too. People just dodge at the wrong timings.
20	Glad that you have the courage to make the call.
4	I agree w that.
7	Are you honestly being serious? I have a hard time believing that you can afford it
26	What a loser, sad. 
20	Women punish men who ***openly*** process their emotions.
3	The least offensive example of anyone I've seen telling me to go fuck myself.
5	I'm having a hard time understanding what exactly happened. I'm sorry you're having these problems. üôÅ
5	I know from personal experience that that can be the end of any good relationship.
20	something something thats how we do it in philly
6	How else can you boil water in prison
27	I will be surprised if this actually has an impact. Just a few statements about the importance of the commitment to defeat ISIS and the withdrawal will continue.
17	No! You've gotta make it warm, let it sit in the sun and have all the sugar dissolve into it! THEN you chill it!
6	Is that a normal price for this kind of thing or is it [NAME] expecting a super-wealthy person to impulse buy?
20	"""...but then some guy on internet promised, yes promised, that [NAME] existed, and it turned my life around"". Dude, come on..."
7	That's interesting, considering that the other area is Mt. Tremblant, which is a real area of Qu√®bec.

4	Yea I have Columbia not peoples. Though I don‚Äôt think the therm price is much different
10	I love the night shift environment, but hate the lifestyle. I just can't do it.

20	Looks like someone's got a bad case of the zoomies.
20	Oh this belongs here
20	With [NAME] performance yesterday, do we need a new striker or he just needs more goals to get his confidence up back?
0	i‚Äôve heard great things from the people who actually saw it. Thriller is my favorite genre so it seems right up my alley
20	Incendiary headline in the Stranger? check Ridiculous over-stated premise trying to create controversy out of very little fact? check. Must Be Mudede
27	Why? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen someone not like [NAME] irl or here. Witten I can see though.
11	He's also a chaser and is convinced that shouting at someone is an escalation from a shooting spree. He is incredibly dumb.
3	Honestly if you had to live in punchbowl you‚Äôd be angry too
3	I'm so stupid, I can do this. On accident. so not very well.
9	You gotta try harder than that. That wouldnt even take a bronze in mental gymnastics
15	Really liked your law and dragon ones man. Good stuff.
26	It‚Äôs sad that some parents can‚Äôt accept some simple mistakes.
4	Except for [NAME] whose remains are either still on the way to Winterfell or lost altogether
20	Some of them are delusional and believe their victims want it
26	For some reason I wanted to be a bartender when I was 8. After hearing this story, makes me feel I missed out. 
1	I mean fun
26	felt that so hard too
10	Wait, I see the problem, you are changing the word observation to assumption, which I think you know is disingenuous.
3	You're being loyal to your mother, who's cheating, and betraying your dad, who's faithful. You might want to think about that.
20	Then you‚Äôre entirely ignorant
1	Believe it or not, I actually am. With the exception of stupidity. 
6	For 3 months so far. I‚Äôm not sure because I never had any successful withdrawals yet.
13	The guys rappelling on the wall... Wow.
3	Bitch subscribed to 1st look at [NAME] shitposts.
10	The ‚Äútargets‚Äù so far has been guilty.
15	Brilliant, thanks so much!
24	Finally! Somebody who legitimately hates planet Jupiter!
20	*sees title* hello there!
20	I know right, im pre everything but sometimes i paint my nails and people will tell me how much they look like a womands hands.
6	I did watch it and didn‚Äôt see the thing OP mentioned. So I am not sure what I was supposed to gain from watching.
4	That's not her. This is she is in the movie:
20	And who are you on twitch?
20	1. Left tiddy 2. Right tiddy
18	If I met a woman that loved me and I her, that stuff wouldnt cross my mind. Its life. You make it work. 
20	Who is this Wild team? Where have they been?
4	 Therapy really is the only way. It's not easy, but maybe therapy will help you learn to love yourself enough to love someone else one day. 
23	Ah. Ok. I get it. Have an upvote.
1	No problem here. Bio hardly ever matches the personality
1	r/choosingbeggars boy is it frustrating yet hilarious
11	I hate these memes because [NAME] never cared if he did or didn't have a nose.
27	Wait there are more psychopaths in this world than are diagnosed? Color me shocked
4	They look incredibly legal, organized, and accurate, just like yours! 
6	Sure but what are you basing that off of? If [NAME] is the best jump-ball receiver, wouldn't that make him the best red zone receiver?
15	Thank you for this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü¶µüèº
20	All we are is dust in the wind.
3	Tbh I think there are a lot of parts of chicago that are way shittier than memphis
20	if you ever played hardcore in previous titles with no doritos you would know that this in fact not the case
21	Over in r/texas we are coming up with slogans to ecourage people to switch to renewable.
20	Been living in US for 4 months. Saying obesity is out of hand would be an understatement.
16	This made me cringe so hard
3	I‚Äôm still waiting for 4 EBT withdrawals marked complete on Dec 7th 2018. Later date EBT withdrawals were paid oddly.
7	Interesting. I recognize way more of the 2019 names than I did from last year. Any hope that means I'm getting younger?!
20	Did you just equate the tomahawk chant to lynching as a reply to being called out for virtue signaling?
17	"I have no idea what ""[NAME]"" is. These billion and one denominations are getting kind of ridiculous."

27	That is odd.
20	Dude who knows u cant tell what a chemical is based on taste
12	I couldn‚Äôt agree more! I think deep down all I wish for is some weird validation from women
0	That‚Äôs good but why would you waste your time on a crappy team?
21	We might now be almost maybe nearly ready to potentially maybe play finals. I think [NAME] will make the finals this year. They'll be the surprise team.
3	This hit me a little too close to home
2	You told me it was pointless to point it out. You're the idiot
0	She was eating gates BBQ at one point. KANSAS CITY PRIDE
20	Yeah, that's why I feel [NAME] or [NAME] would have a better chance.
18	Ace here! I do masturbate and enjoy it, I just feel no sexual attraction or desire to have sex with other people.
21	About as much say so as the Walmart employee that stocks the shelves.
15	Yes, I know. But thanks, no damage to the second car and just some scratches on mine.
3	I don‚Äôt understand why this is a problem? Each of you just plate up your own food and then eat together.
20	They would be part of a nation controlled by the media.
20	Mean daddy not taking her out again.

15	Thank you. I realise I have to start from scratch
0	i think the telekinesis could make a great card. sth like: move an enemy card to another position and stun its new neighbors for this round.

18	I love the holiday overlay for The Haunted Mansion.
20	People can't afford my products, i'm not selling anything. Issue for the producer to reduce price

20	Oh yeah? Name one nature reserve or park and how will the wall affect them?
3	BOUNDARIES. have some boundaries. say no. don't go. this is frustrating to read, honestly. don't do things that you hate doing.
20	At least it looks like you're prepared for a good evening in spite of being ghosted:-)
12	> What are your thoughts on public breastfeeding? What a strange question to ask üòÇüòÇüòÇ. 
20	Many a prick, as I recall. You could track them down but then it'd be pointless. 
4	I love having twins. They'll keep each other company in their room until about 7:30-8:00 every day. So nice.

4	Tbh the floor is probably more comfortable than the seats. Doesn't make it safe though.
7	Didn't he also come in half way through the season? üòè Not defending [NAME] or hating on [NAME]. 
10	i truly believe compulsive, chronic cheaters are sociopaths. no empathy, compassion, and they're impulsive and manipulative
10	He isn't unique to that. Every defensive metric disagrees ü§î
8	That was the middle school dream
10	No it‚Äôs a lie because he could not possibly have been in Vietnam. And he did not correct a single outlet who said he was.
3	I have a bad one but I also have mild cerebral palsy on my left side

2	A sharp stick? I think you need a rifle to kill that bastard
0	I like it, more please. 
3	I think you're right. She has oodles of cash and young grandchildren to enjoy. Going through that hideous gauntlet again probably isn't that appealing.
0	I sure hope this dog is reunited with its family. It is one of the cutest dogs I‚Äôve seen, a very unique looking pup!
27	I think Judge came in a little too late so he‚Äôll need to be amazing for the next 8 years

26	It's even more useless if there is no other source of power (capacitor, etc.) other than the sun to work.
3	>an absolute cuck Only a cuck would use that unironically so yeah probably
20	It most likely isn‚Äôt foreshadowing. [NAME] sings, and the song has [NAME] name in it.
1	Yeah deffo seen mom do that trick with a Hotdog :) lmao
4	Keep gg too bro!
27	Hmm. Never saw a COMMENT downvoted!
1	> 82 percent of black voters trusting [NAME] and two percent trusting [NAME] Seems kinda high for [NAME] lol

20	I forget it all the time too.
20	I don't think WI is lean red, after 2018 I'd argue for it being either tossup or lean blue.

20	yeah because 10 days ago [NAME] was still playing dumbass
13	Of course! Happy cake day üéÇüéâ
20	If [NAME] inferior pinning move can pierce hyper armour why can't my man Glad.

4	Same. They responded really quickly like within an hour.
3	Ways to fool others into believing you didn't lose your eyes in a horrible accident
4	Yep i always say this. Absolutely best case scenario is a foul ball. If he puts it in play it's probably a dribbler.
2	Which three of you motherfuckers changed it from 666 upvotes when I clicked on this post?
17	What a time to be alive.
17	The no rape was my favorite part, so glad people agree

0	He‚Äôs a brave man.
0	That's a giant, adorable, super-good woofer you got right there!
21	[NAME], I hope your plot armor is strong enough to save [NAME] from a ship crash.

11	she disrespected [NAME], i dont like her
0	Ah [NAME] trying to save the faith by strawmanning amazing.
0	This needs to be a series. Start a series. For the love all that's holy on reddit, please...make a series.
0	Yeah he does give intense and memorable performances. He didn't get to speak in Mad Max for like half an hour but he was still riveting.
20	The super bowl isnt played in march my man
20	She started off with 'can't give it up that easily' Op is stuck with her until one of them have expired!!
20	There is no Mrs [NAME]. Unless you count his sister.
21	Hope they don't pull another [NAME] on [NAME]. Good to hear [NAME] added muscle and is healthy. Hopefully he and [NAME] can play all 16 this season
14	Boy you sure can make some word vomit. You must be scared all the time to have such pessimistic views of people.
20	Simply explain the situation as you did here, don‚Äôt use any cliches or anything just be honest about it.
21	Future is bright to me!
18	"I love this; now when commies say they had the word ""libertarian"" first, we can say we had class analysis first!"

21	I hope you and your retarded phone have a nice day!
1	Eventually sure. But the question really lacked the maybe later option lol
21	Here Hope that helps!
26	Both [NAME] and [NAME] were broken up, so it wasnt cheating.
5	That's good to know, then. You can eliminate that possibility from your mind. But gosh. I'm so sorry you went through all that... 
1	Haha. Yeah there is a vaccination now. When I was a kid my parents did the same thing. It hadn‚Äôt been developed yet.
14	It was intentional. Maybe not with much thought behind it, but a very dangerous instinct.
1	It would hilarious, but also kind of sad.
0	Having a good list of alternatives would be something great we could produce

1	[NAME] should be in jail lol
8	I love your collection and want to play with it! p.s. am 40
14	Gulags... Brexiteering. The mental condition where delusional and psychotic thinking occur simultaneously.
20	So if MB3 replaces WCS, who exactly do you see as the future for your forward spots?
20	Idk why you‚Äôre getting down voted I also pick it every time and almost always get it done on that initial skirmish
20	What. The. Fresh. Fuck.
10	I'm not worthy to watch this haha
15	I guess this is place where we are thankful for Microsoft complexity.
27	Oh my [NAME]...
20	Exactly my point, he was tearing up the U23's but hasnt been able to push on with the first team chances he was given.
4	Get Ready!
20	- (sorry) -
20	This is simply honesty + humility. Indeed, very respectable.
3	/s. There you go. I have magically inverted the meaning of my comment and removed all inconvenient truth from it
20	"""I'll leave I'll leaveeee!!!!"""
14	I'm more worried about it randomly saying daddy across the top ... Like that's normal
5	Let [NAME] think about his performance for this 2 week break, god that was a brutal last 5 mins 
20	As someone else has mentioned it is not theft technically. So that will probably only cause more problems for myself.
20	Grant us pies, grant us pies.
27	Wow, so that means common tongue isn‚Äôt English!?!
1	I'm sure you do lmfao...
10	He's controversial from what I know. A canny leader to be sure, but his coziness with Dominion Energy has unnerved some [NAME]. 
15	Thank you for mentioning that!
3	Many of them are actively being courted and convinced by People's Vote activists. You just actively avoid acknowledging that fact.
23	Maybe that‚Äôs what happened to the great white at Houston zoo
7	I'm genuinely curious how Russia's vested interest in South Africa will have any impact on the way that Russian news reports on SA
4	I can only download games using SteamCMD at work at the moment, so yeah, glad I could buy it before the shutdown

20	Did he mention what you guys would do?
2	She should not defend herself? Stop blaming both sides.
9	I hate this comment. More-so, I hate how likely this comment is to reach fruition. 
20	wouldn't it actually probably be Army?
1	Thoroughly entertaining.
20	WE LIKE SPORTZ AND WE DON‚ÄôT CARE WHO KNOWS

18	I like it!
3	Damnit, it was *Flavor-Aid*, not Kool-Aid.
2	Today on someone flamed me in chat

15	Your comment has been removed for shaming. Thanks [NAME]
2	> it's not the fault of the mods or uses of this sub. They are the people enforcing it. Why wouldn't you blame them?
13	OH MY GOD OH MY GOD CONGRATS!!!!

7	"...if there is a way to edit this to ""original content"" I'd love some coaching on that. Thanks folks! "
10	It is hard to make up the new relevant points at times.... Revolution they say
9	Thank you [NAME].. Another disaster you created.
4	I bet you get tired of people looking through your post history and using your anti-semitism to dismiss you as utter trash too.
20	Honestly I think most of that sort of stuff existed between the 1985-2012-ish. Depending on your age most young people would have experienced these.
4	what has helped me was to figure out the root cause of the anger and address those feelings rather than hold onto the anger.
0	Atonement is just something else. [NAME] is just so lovely in his writing.
20	You deserve WAY more upvotes
8	Maybe I have the mind of a child but I found that entertaining like I‚Äôd upvote it if I just saw it
20	Fluid to the top!
20	What does that do with having the buyer sign the title?
1	[NAME] i actally kind of like [NAME] but he is such a punk
20	It‚Äôs a vegan restaurant called Ipanema! I got a tofu Caesar wrap!!
20	I applaud both of you for taking whatever action you can to make this succeed. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt offer any advice. Good luck.
10	I know they're probobly not good but I love charged hadoken into vskill combos/mixups. It makes her fireball more interesting than just a zoning tool.
5	"Has there even been a time when a *good* Doxing happened? ""We're going to find this guy and hug the crap outta him!"""
20	Sounds dreadful.
23	I thought you would say it was because Finland doesn‚Äôt really exist.
9	Then you're awfully worked up over people seeing the world differently
6	What would that do? So you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm 100% gonna be diabetic
10	No but that's why I stay up way too late.
20	Sooner or later you're both going to have to make some choices about your priorities.
0	I loved it so much more than I thought I would! [NAME] does an amazing job with quite a bizarre concept!

20	Misery loves company
20	Call me biased but St Kilda's clash jersey is the best thing they've done on and off field in the last two years.
20	Women always seem to write that though, plus emotipns and emojis. When a man writes likr that it comes off odd ajd feminine in a bad way.
1	I‚Äôd say her knee is more done, ankle looks ok but I‚Äôm n doctor lol
7	Could be using a library?
4	Yea I would've lost it there
9	No, he wasn't the entire problem, but his performance can't be excused by coaching alone. He's just not very good.
1	Haha I can drink to that! Cheers man!

0	Can these be made so in the future it could be made even higher? Like adding an additional 15 feet or so? Would be cool...
4	My point is that IQ basically works. As with literally everything, there are flaws, but it's not junk science. 
2	I'm not crying, you're crying
18	I love being down by 10+ constantly.... I feel like [NAME] gets dominated by literally everyone.
9	Matchroom squad dismiss [NAME] as not existing anymore, the sky media influence is scary 
7	What exactly do you personally think that meme is saying, please point back to the meme for each argument you make. 
0	Exactly! It amazes me how many people dont communicate with each other. Talk about it, see what they say. Discuss. Come to a conclusion.
15	Metallica recorded a congratulatory video for him, so effin cool: 
3	I personally think think life is beautiful but living is hell, kinda like a hurricane can be the most beautiful thing.
20	Anyone who complains about being a loser is a loser.

4	Hahha i agree but i still want him to say sorry.
4	Wait until the clandestine plumber come in. (This is possibly one of the most obscure comment I will have ever wrote.)
0	PATRIOTS BABY BRING IT ON!
20	Yeah she is. Do you think [NAME] faced the same problems [NAME] had? like you said major problems in the prosecution
14	This could only end badly.
20	I've not- I'll have to put it on my watchlist.
9	I know they don‚Äôt want it. I just wish they did.

20	Yeah, that's gonna happen
20	[NAME] looks so defeated every time [NAME] posts him up
4	Good, hope he actually takes that to heart!
20	You mean more handouts than they already get?
6	It bothers me that certain people praise him as an entertainer and could care unless about what he did. Look at [NAME]... Makes me question humanityü§î
18	She looks so FIERCE. I love it.
1	That would be hilariously vicariously through the subterranean passages to the bottom of this post.
7	Whoa whoa whoa, dont go firing him into the rest of us. He is your alien being
20	I stopped watching [NAME] the moment vie when they made the sub surface and I realised they were rewriting history. It's insulting.

15	I wear pantyliners mostly every day now due to my random spotting, it helps but I feel the odor is seeping through my clothes. Thanks for the suggestion
7	Are you in love with the memories or do you still love him for who he is now?
20	On the contrary, he gets off on his own ego and the delusion shattering reality of intimacy with another person makes him limp as a wet noodle.
15	Thank you so much I'm going to start it right after the Golden Globes!
12	I like how he wrote many of the TRUE [NAME]. I wonder what a fake [NAME] believes in.
4	It did! Good luck on yours!! -[NAME]
16	The Colts badly wanted to hire him. He‚Äôd get a GM job in a heartbeat if he wanted it.

20	[NAME] what's your opinion on this?
21	Ugh. Nice season from him, hoping he can build on it next year and play a bigger role at the world juniors.
20	You can remove them without killing or etc etc. Just stop reproduction
3	I want to bounce a whole roll of quarters off that ass, holy shit.

25	Ah if they went to school together that makes more sense. I wasn't aware of that.
20	Now there‚Äôs a thought...
17	Fun fact: [NAME] decided to delete an entire string of comments after mine because they made him look like more of a man-child than he already is ;)
20	Uh, no. Not even remotely.
10	I get it but it wasn't what i was talking about.
10	It didn‚Äôt help [NAME]. He should have invested in a crosscut, it might have been a bigger challenge to put back together

20	Dammit I got whooshed
20	He reminded me more of [NAME] last year. His lumbering skating this year makes him look different.
17	Twas a joke ‚ù§Ô∏è
0	Then [NAME] took little Donnie Two Scoops out to get a happy meal because he's been such a good top businessman!

20	I'm a D.Va main at the moment so that one's a check chief.
9	What's with the buying porn thing? I missed out on it
4	That is a bad reason to come back to her. Better to be alone for the right reasons than be with someone for the wrong reasons.
11	Seems like you jerk off looking at mirror while you‚Äôre crying
15	"Sure glad I wasn't coming the other way when this twatwaffle decided to try his ""watch this sick drift, yo"" stunt."
10	"Probably because they are trying to talk about the issues that ""corporate dems"" tend to ignore. "

4	I think it has more to do with them deriving a sense of identity from work. Remove the work and what remains?
20	I'm worried he's too small. I love his quickness, but sub-170 is scary for a guy that'll be running over the middle.
4	Came here to say that. I'm genuinely astounded that it's as much as 12%.
20	He only has 1 cap in a friendly but that's fine. Just can't play in a competitive international match.
10	Not really. All pretty random injuries.
3	Surely this particular one an extreme example? Thinking his brother is a lizard....

6	Did you just say suck a fuck?
0	Mr. Steal Yo Perfect Season
7	Why not $1 million per hour muhahahah

20	Not all of them, but this guy happens to be in a team called Moustache Mountain.

6	Disinfected or sanitized maybe. No way an entire exam table is sterilized.
2	Thank you for charging your fucking phone!

20	Someone on r/nba said [NAME] was borderline elite defensively...lol
0	It's gorgeous
19	It's just a human problem. I lose track of how many stories a month come out about some teacher getting caught sexually abusing 1-3 of her students.
21	I really hope [NAME] gets a great helm. A crown would be cool but I want a properly armored sword and board knight.
3	"I would pay money for [NAME] to not be my nurse. She will probably ""accudentally"" squeeze my nuts. Crazy bitch."

20	All children should be given the option to learn about how to effectively use the rights they‚Äôre entitled to.
3	[NAME] i feel personally attacked
20	I think most of these pictures would be much scarier if we had the perspective of the guy
6	Then yeah, not really. I can't think of a specific type of evolutionary pressure that would lead us to developing an ability like that.
21	That was one of the things that I didn't think about and I already gave a delta for that.

20	BY [NAME] THAT'S [NAME] MUSIC!
11	Pure unadulterated hatred. It‚Äôs disgusting.

15	Ok im om the hunt thanks
20	Now that I've seen this, I would like to petition that Warden is just another sentient suit of armour.

27	That would look enormous if [NAME] ordered it!
20	*looks at title* IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?!?!?!?!?!?

25	Apologies, I take it all back as I‚Äôve just seen his latest effort
18	...i love [NAME] for what she did/does for her [NAME]. ...also, would like to see some of the work that comes out of the collective
2	I still think hating [NAME] isn't a good move for them. Could turn those undocumented [NAME] into undocumented [NAME].
4	Not with me, no. I‚Äôm a true social butterfly 
20	That has nothing to do with guys that just started with us this or last season.
4	Signatures are no longer required for transactions in the US as of April last year, so I guess this no longer applies really.

20	Rose coloured glasses get rosier as time goes by :) You'll move on eventually. Treasure the memory but be present in your current and future relationships.
2	Your passion for [NAME] literally put a big smile on my face. Stay wavy!
20	It's an Albany expression
25	Collusion! Nah but seriously, Knicks need to fall back. 
10	One of the most posted things on reddit. Please delete
9	The only person I didn't want was [NAME], and I ended up getting [NAME]... 
20	Two guys from the Westbank already did this
8	I love the aunt. Hope she doesn't back down.
3	Having sex with a child in the room is often difficult and boring.
20	Chromie, for sure
0	I liked the Japandroids for that one year
20	Go get another phone!
15	Thanks so much! I'll let you know how it goes when I get a chance to try it :)
1	starting a new trend lol
1	Funny how the [NAME] leaves the most important item out of their article headline.
9	Nah, I know why I am depressed, and I'm sorry to say it has nothing to do with you. 
20	Meritocracy ftw!
6	Did you check the bowl?
27	Shockingly, some people continue to educate and improve themselves. You might benefit from it.
20	Yep. Id say ever since Diablo 3 it was shown that the company was no more. They no longer were gamers making games for gamers.
9	Dopey may is still relevant. Delors is not. So your comparison falls flat. Do try keep up.
20	Sounds like he wants to strongly pretend he's not paying for sex.
5	If you like Thai food, try Firefly.
20	Wasn't north and south Dakota one state at some point? Are they putting aside they're difference and getting back together?
20	Baseless assumptions about cops on Reddit without any context?
10	Nope, not my department.
20	That works too. To each their own.
0	I can‚Äôt stop staring at the boobs
3	Dumpster fire. I cant quit you Edmonton!!
23	I've heard of alligator boots, but I always thought that meant something else.
2	Dude what's wrong with you? 4 years in a secret relationship.. you shouldn't be in one of your not comfortable telling people
20	ESPN said [NAME] doesn't deserve to because he should have the Pistons playing better and shouldn't be on the outside looking into the playoffs right now
26	Which is why not only did PR lose but RUP was not the first choice sadly even if it had won in BC :(
3	 Calm down and relax are the worst things to say to a woman, ever. 
4	This. Fans complain that she's boring but I'm actually glad she's careful about what she allows to be filmed.
4	"I didn't say ""do it for the children,"" but I understand if reading isn't a strong suit for you."
0	Way to go! I know who this couple is! they appear really happy!
20	Wanna know how hard I hit it? I hit it into next week.
3	And then they clapped and gave you $100, I'm sure
2	Seems highly unethical for a lawyer to sign exclusive coverage contracts on their pending cases.
15	u/-adamsmith perfect troll account name, but at least he united all of r/MLS. Thanks for teaming up, everyone.
18	I love it.
17	Poor fella just got his arms out of plaster and we‚Äôre already making fun of him
13	Thank you. Yeah it's a nice thought, being sheltered and happy before any worries or drama. It would be nice...
1	I didn‚Äôt know I could roll my eyes this far into my head
17	giving great [NAME] vibes
6	After how badly the Patriots screwed CT, how can anyone like them?
0	I had no idea what the fuck this was about. Found the ad and watched it. It's actually decent.
6	I admitted to myself that I had no other reason to think [NAME] was real. Kind of tough to stay [RELIGION], after that. 
15	Thanks!! Been avoiding this but I literally am in that area for the Elk pelt so I better put my emotions in a case
0	[NAME] Late Registration my favorite and Gone my favorite song even though it's hard as fuck to choose
6	Why it got removed.
17	i'm enjoying this so much
17	I suppose I failed to lay the sarcasm on thick enough, should have gone with the full billion dollar contract... Oh well, live and learn! lol 
2	It's hard to respect them as an organization when we hear shit like this. They will struggle as a franchise to win another WS anytime soon.
20	It would be quite difficult, considering that I don't actually have any to begin with, hence the question. 
20	Wait wait wait... did [NAME] go 61-27??
0	She‚Äôs so hot. Also happy cake day
20	Didn't [NAME] say that [NAME] was going to be on?
26	This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
4	Omg I thought he was actually fired lol. Got excited ! I still approve tho
20	What is a punishment if not an undesirable consequence imposed by others?
20	And you didn't read the filler did you?
11	That pedo ring that developed under [NAME] tenure makes him the worst owner of a sports team ever, bar none.
23	if HL in offensive stance dodges it, then doesn't raider also dodge it? Or is that fast recovery into moves that are not dodging again?
3	Do as I say, Not as I do
2	stupid science bitches
20	Politicians be like yo we cant raise minimum wage because then companies will just replace all their workers with robots...
20	Think about it as a normal match then be confident in your play.
21	Good luck!
20	Oh, with that title I thought the crocodile was gonna- oh.
20	If they actually have more evidence that he was deeper than originally suspected, then I have no sympathy.
13	Ty going through a lot right now and this made me smile.
1	That's crazy; I went to a super [RELIGION] high school and I think I can remember 2 girls the entire 4 years that became teen moms.
20	More like lovely shiny apples and rotten oranges covered with mold.
5	Damn girl, Stockholm syndrome is strong with you. All I can say is I wish you all the best.
20	[NAME] already had that in their comment and I didn't deny it. I guess that level of attention to detail isn't taught at Bellevue Community College.
6	Why or when was he ever a locker room cancer though? Am I missing something? Thanks for the downvote for asking a question, though. 
7	Unbelievable! Here. Have your iPad back. Not interested in being treated like a criminal. I‚Äôll write home with pen and paper
0	She looks pretty big to me. I doubt she‚Äôs within a healthy weight range.
20	The real joke is always in the comments.
10	so you can't state it definitively, therefore you think it's a possibility so i was right all along. i thought so
27	Wow, I know he is the voice of [NAME], but I did not know he basically IS [NAME]
15	I've heard of Ne Obliviscaris and the Ocean. I'll check these out, thanks!
27	ISN'T YOUR CLUB RUN BY A JABBA-THE-HUT-LOOKING DONALD-TRUMP-ACTING MORON WITH A ~~FIVE SIX SEVEN TEN~~ FIFTEEN YEAR PLAN?
20	No thank you, we need to tank, and this moves us 1 gb from the #6 pick :)
0	I'm sure he immensely appreciates the gesture.
20	DONT DO IT PRELLER
20	Kawhi and Siakam chemistry
9	The smile on these guys face, the will and passion to explore all gone in a second. Rest in peace explorers!
20	For the love of all that is good and holy, please find competent broadcasters NBCSN.
20	Idk man, some people just have wack combinations. I'm a Yankees/Panthers/Jazz fan, it doesn't have to make any sense. 
18	My wife's birthday today, we are going for dinner with my lovely girlfriend later, after meeting at ours for coffee and cake. Very happy
20	Much less legal racism, much more corruption, crime, dysfunction, decay etc
20	AM I BEING DETAINED?
20	‚Äú[NAME] bring the wipers, I thought I farded but I accidentally shidded.‚Äù
3	Sucks when people misunderstand philosophy right
20	I‚Äôm not arguing for it. I just think the punishment doesn‚Äôt fit the crime.
25	oh wow never heard of that in my life sorry
24	At last, someone I can share this accomplishment with! 
27	Wow I bet someone would look at this and get inspired to make a movie about aliens with [NAME]
18	this is why I love reddit
16	Nah it's a sexual disorder due to brain structure not aligning with body structure but continue to be an ignorant transphobe I guess.
20	And mass migration
7	This is in vaucluse ?
9	I Said that‚Äôs it‚Äôs unrealistic that he take gear !
7	what's a friend
6	Now I'm over thinking. Maybe I have justified it to be able to move on and get closure???
11	It's not free, though. It's ridiculously expensive.
20	Honestly capital G god is probaby the only diety I would struggle allowing at my table, no matter which [NAME] religion it was picked from.
22	He also owes [NAME]. a little payback.
0	Very handsome!!
4	That's fine. I'm searching for the truth, not just the legal truth. To each their own. 
1	I want to see him succeed. Mostly because his last name makes me think of the bad guy from Shrek
0	Nice job dude!
8	Yeah I realised that a bit too late. I still wanted to further explain myself regardless but thank you for being nice about it.
18	I love how that's pretty much all they can do, literally beg for him not to run.
20	All Dressed Ruffles are my vice, but potato chips make me sick. I wouldn't go so far as to lick the seasoning off, though..
3	Oh fuck off already.
20	So I'll just hide behind my newspaper then.
5	"Kids, if you're on a dating site that advertises itself as ""dating site for millionaires"" you're gonna have a bad time"
10	That wasn‚Äôt part of my plan
9	It‚Äôs a really depressing show. Kinda like Mad Men.
0	I once got flowers from a girl... idk why but it just feels good
7	I‚Äôm slowly starting to get excited about what we will do with the draft pick(s?) they will most likely get in a trade
20	The BBC covered up a pedophile story involving high ranking politicians. No thank you. They are basically the public relations branch of the government.
4	She has major SBüòñ
2	Aaaaaand they turned it off. Terrible roads everywhere.
20	I don't think I've ever seen that flag flying in this city, we mostly just have the provincial flag and the Canada flag
4	We're in this together! Pandora's box has been opened! There is no turning back!
3	Ok this New England accent not so fun!!
8	I like to support anybody who supports veganism, especially at places like this, to show them their is a demand, and a future for it
15	Your welcome.
6	Wasn't the scar originally across his nose but [NAME] moved it?
5	They remembered [NAME]
5	But beat the warriors Celtics and rockets. Pistons love messing with our emotions
9	Because there isn‚Äôt an unlimited supply of beautiful 20-year-olds.
21	Volunteer. Helping people in need will make you feel better about both yourself and others.
20	Hi I‚Äôm [NAME], why don‚Äôt you take a seat over there.
1	Now we all know someone is going to domesticate these cute fluff butts
16	Sad. My condolences to her family.
10	I hate this comment. More-so, I hate how likely this comment is to reach fruition. 
8	I wish they let him do the quatrains once a week during the NFL season.
1	that missed dunk is so symbolic of [NAME] lol
4	Yeah, the gauntlet ruins everything
20	It's more laid back, which I kinda love.
1	Lol, nah, that team was nothing more than nyxl and friends. Nyxl coach, and mostly nyxl players.
18	[NAME], you are such a pretty girl. 
13	Ayyy you're welcome! x)
12	My bad on the phrasing, it‚Äôs more of a hole with a vent cover 
23	Funny because I only owe 20k... I guess no one told these kids community college exists.
0	I think Limmy's Show is really hit and miss. Some sketches are funny, others are just poor.
20	I would get up and gently wake the guy-he could have broken his jaw-
20	You‚Äôre doing gods work.
20	"Finally, a real ""murderedbywords"" than the constant string of silly roasts."
20	Let's kill and eat them all. That'll stop those damned animals from deforesting my forests
6	Not sure if I'm having a woosh moment or you think I meant something else...
20	Get more crushes.
20	True :/
18	I love how he looks around for a flag and doesn‚Äôt celebrate at first
4	I feel like [NAME] had the right idea losing the will to live. Now if only I could learn this power...
20	culver's is good shit edit: not saying that you were saying it was bad, just to clarify
9	Too late with having it back. I really did'nt have much back then. So I had a really hard time too.
4	I was hoping to hear this. I'm up for it I think. I'll download it tomorrow.
5	Why? They deserve it.
10	Idiots are downvoting your correct comment.
15	Thank [NAME].
8	Can't you tell that [NAME] is a serious threat to apprehend. All that alleged lying makes him a serious threat to others.
6	So kinda like an assistant? Interesting
9	someone should of grabbed [NAME] by his foot and use him as a club to bash [NAME]..
23	[NAME] with the truth that reality show does not = relevance.
7	Seriously. I wonder if OP has seen some of the amazingly stupid faces that [NAME] and [NAME] make.
0	‚ÄúOur decaf is like really good tho gurl, you‚Äôll be okay‚Äù
0	Just tell her how you feel and make the next move
7	I'm genuinely curious how Russia's vested interest in South Africa will have any impact on the way that Russian news reports on SA
20	In the Garden of Femininity, of course!
9	I know right I was very disappointed when I saw who it was
7	Just for the sake of accuracy, is there a citation for this quotation. It is spicy, but I can‚Äôt bother to check right now.
12	I feel I should do this even after living here for 7 years, I've barely done any touristy things! Shame on me.
20	And he will...Hence he shrugs off whatever you said and continues to treat dashers like trash.
20	Boom. Sand. Great image
2	Oh we‚Äôre TANKING tanking
10	Well one of our leading candidates is [NAME] so it's not like we're killing it in our search either
20	I'm guessing that it maybe due to being overwhelmed w/ responses and having a relatively small staff to go through all the forms.
20	When my Dad ([NAME] all the way) is Tsar of the Earth I'll have him make doxxing a crime with mandatory sentencing to terrible things.
22	Hey I‚Äôm going to eli today! Unfortunately for a funeral but hello stranger :)
3	The whole post reeks of troll.
2	Not only do they make me cringe, I become angry because usually or is my nmother and her flying monkey daughter posting them. Just horrible.
20	I hardly ever post in r/bitcoin. But then, r/Bitcoin isn't pretending Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.
20	Just to set up for a bigger failure story in the coming days. I think the guys at epoch times are working extra hours this weekend.
20	I have never noticed dread doing shady stuff. Dream, well, duh.
15	Thank you for the link I'm going to post their also
20	Also featuring the dat ass meme in the 2nd panel and the LOL rage face in the 4th. Both ancient but apparently still considered funny by some.
27	The way it took out that tree!!
20	There to busy guzzling down Russian propoganda , to enact a final solution on tmor.
3	Are you confessing to not being able to understand what this sub is about?
26	Did that with an oven pizza at 3am in my underwear. Got burns all over my stomach
10	Ah, didn‚Äôt know that but can‚Äôt blame him. Thanks!
0	Da‚Äôts a beauty. Got sniped at auction with seconds left to lose [NAME] from this summer.
18	If you have any other links handy I'd love to see them.
20	You‚Äôre a genius.
20	No femshaming, guys.
20	I'm surprised [NAME] didn't bust that dress open when she bent down to high [NAME]
20	Since you seem to have posted this twice, I would recommend you take this down.
20	She is :(
5	> Books. Love them, have enough The library is your friend :)
11	Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.
10	Haha WEHO, for West Hollywood, not Wehoe for We hoes
7	What else did you expect?
2	That's the main reason to play [NAME]? I hate it too.
6	Are they sure one didn't kill the other and themselves?
0	Don't see it at all, but she's cute with the freckles
26	I think I got gout from watching this.
20	You got shafted.
11	Everyone makes mistakes tho... at least he only allowed 1 mistake to go for a goal
20	Because it's like she's a child, though it would be weird to explain it right then.
25	always try to avoid triggers - my last 12 day streak was suddenly toppled by a trigger - no urges and then, suddenly, a *massive* urge
27	Anyone know how high of a fall that was? Edit: ~4 seconds of falling. .5 X 9.8 X 4^2 = ~78 feet.
2	Astrology and asttonomy used to be the same thing. The scientific aspect diverged and got renamed to astronomy to distance itself from the bullshit.
25	oml I‚Äôm so sorry OP for all that
4	Just goes to show it takes 0 skill to play that hero
26	The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
20	What happened?
21	It's got home made bread pudding so therefore the rest has to be good!
20	Me too, but unlike phones humans can ‚Äûlife‚Äú without the other
7	Are your boys really doing the hand clap meme? Holy crap is this cringey.
20	There were people who knew about that before Vice. Not me, but people.
21	Just woke up from one. Glad to know it's not just me. Hope you have a good return!
20	You talk the talk without walking the walk. You cannot be a [NAME] and worship [NAME].
7	How are they significant? Israel does these exercises all the time?
20	Thank you!!! /s
21	I haven't watched the original FMA, but you're definitely in for a fun ride with Brotherhood. Hope you enjoy it!
2	Fuck you.
4	Unsurprisingly our closest competitors will try to capitalise as we stumble. Good luck to them, we have brought this on ourselves. 
26	Oh that's so sad
4	Sometimes it can be very expensive and can have a toll on mental health
26	This would make me sick.Getting cucked by bayern on and off the field.
20	Holy crap, what happened to that guy?
4	I‚Äôll have to check that later, seems kinda weird if that‚Äôs the case
21	I think I will try to push through, I guess I can always drop a class or two if it‚Äôs too much and even take a break 
9	I missed that part unfortunately
13	Fucking happy this jerk is still well and alive.
0	Yepp, plenty of people like a nice big bush! I literally have no preference and think both are totally sexy. 
20	Was this at Meadowvale? I wanted to take a pic but had my gloves on
20	Yikes at that title dude
20	NSFW If anyone is wondering what happened to his leg (0:48)
20	There is a reason I said allegedly.
0	sick shirt [NAME] is a great artist
2	[NAME] can‚Äôt you see, you‚Äôre being way too loud for me
6	was that hutty from [NAME]?? ahhh that makes me so happy. love those boys e: oh it was a rebound
26	I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
20	Meanwhile, in a certain discord
0	Oh noo! You are the best dog owner :)
1	Go to Happiest Hour before/after the game. Walking distance b/w AA center. It's a fun spot!
13	Oh man! Oh boy!
11	These are some of the lamest threatening letters I‚Äôve ever seen. She‚Äôs a metahuman who can you murder people with her voice.
3	Yeah, a lot of people conveniently forget how devastating spacial apartheid was, and how permanent it's effects were designed to be.
3	You've added nothing to this conversation and just repeated what everybody else. Thanks for wasting my time.
13	Any [NAME] who are into this, hit me up! Love me some trance & techno. Can't wait for Transmission Sydney in March :)
4	I find Asian men hot and have dated a few - I'm a white woman
2	Conservatives now hate dancing... anybody surprised?
20	The person he marries is going to be murdered by him
2	Because idiots in this sub care too much about what other people have on their screen? It only tells me that too many people on here are narcissists.
21	I needed to hear this. I'm resigning my good paying FT soul sucking job to try something new. Wish me luck!
23	[NAME] was the [NAME] of the [NAME] years. Didn't realise he was still about.
20	Oop my bad
1	It's not as if she was my supervisor at bestbuy lol.
3	I think that's a reference to how fucking mad watching [NAME] makes people feel. ie shit [NAME] is playing and now I have the furies!
20	We try our hardest.
11	Even worse.
4	Wouldn't wipe my arse with it.
20	I think [NAME] was just holding back, who'd want to go kill their nephew ([NAME] in [NAME]).
20	I'm assuming they sense the change but to translate it onto the screen for the audience they have to have them realize it
7	I'm curious to see what his answer will be
11	Damn, 14 year olds in 2019 are bigger shits than I was when I was 14.
20	GDMNIT! Now I'm hungry!
20	Dude, if this was real you wouldn't have mentioned godfather. 
20	Therapy helps. If only to just talk and be able to process what has happened.
10	Then much of the advice here is terrible because it congratulates him on doing the entirely wrong thing.
20	This is the most pleasant debate I‚Äôve ever had on reddit. Also, $nah$
20	This is getting out of hand! Now there‚Äôs two of them!
9	because my dogs wouldst know why I left. gotta give that little floof ball the best life he can have
18	I like how bro is just underlined for no reason
20	Funny how some people criticize people for not following those laws, when they don't either.
27	NL West had 3 teams in the playoffs in 2017 and 2 in 2018......wtf you on about
25	Oh, sorry! I clicked on your profile and thought you posted this in the BPD sub sorry üòÖ
24	I‚Äôm glad you fixed Minnesota, because there is a 0% chance we will go Red.
20	That's not justification to keep doing it. Also this would be the purview of the Democratic party since it's the primaries we're talking about.
13	*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)
20	You guys really hate the Seahawks more than the Cowboys? Maybe I'm just old.
15	Ah my apologies xir, did not mean to offend
20	We aren't even buying it's loans and still nobody has been signed
18	this is r/comedyheaven content alright. frick u i love it.
0	I just really don't see 20% for him. I would be very surprised.
0	you seem like the kind of person i‚Äôd like to be best friends with! :)
15	It was [NAME] thank you very much, than I'd go to wumpscut. 
20	She wants to be [NAME] so bad...
15	Agree. Keep trying, then if your rejected every time. I'm sorry your done.
20	Last time I saw was loooong ago. Basically before LN announced they went for probabilistic routing.
4	It actually depends. Do you have PCOS? Because if you do, then that would explain the change as well. 
20	I can't be down with chill. Give me intensity, or give me nothing.
4	Studying something doesn't make you bright. Getting a degree does.
20	"Edit your post and instead of it saying ""face...."" put ""book of faces"". I think thats why your post was removed."
4	[NAME] and [NAME] made their own beds with their own actions. But I agree with this too .
14	Crowder is terrible... How do you lose that gunfight or not have the common sense to just run away
20	Wish the blasters were more like BF1
1	Shit dude I thought I was Mr. [NAME]? Here have some beans lol
10	My biggest problem with Yuri on Ice is that it didn't have enough episodes to show the payoff of their relationship in my opinion.
24	My life is complete
20	Only good ones.
20	>[NAME] later admits to his brother he killed me ~~cause he hates bards~~ because he doesn't have the chops to run a robust encounter. FIFY
8	I want to downvote. But this sub is for stuff like this so I want to upvote. Man being part of interent hazmat is tough
12	I've always wondered how much of this stuff doesn't end up on the internet
20	Aren't reaction gifs *supposed* to be textless? The concept originates from imageboards after all
20	The chick that got out right before him literally said something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat if the elevator starts and I get snapped in half‚Äù üôÑ
0	Bat Out of Hell is awesome start to finish, I'd love to see a musical based on it.
0	He's the best [NAME].
1	Lol the guy in white who just leans back and looks away when he gets [NAME] ass in his face
4	You did it!
13	Hi [NAME] nice to see you
20	Ya know... a helmet never hurt anyone
18	I love how the dog bites hard enough to pull it away, but soft enough to not kill it
20	Here‚Äôs a little update lol so far I‚Äôve had 3 matches today and all of them were ‚Äúcam models‚Äù lmfao
12	Looks like I posted it. Oh no!
15	Thank [NAME] for the adult spammers on my susbscribed NSFW subreddits.
13	You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
0	Literally anything regarding [NAME] and her weird fans belongs here
20	6 and he died of cancer iirc
7	They'll investigate themselves and nothing will happen. Detroit police bully everyone. An they wonder why no one likes them, Respects them, Or why people run from them. 
14	Still waiting on [NAME] to tell me how GIFs are terrible and I can‚Äôt afford to watch anymore of them.
18	I also love the first sentence (but in a more pro-science way than was probably intended)
20	You too thirsty
20	[NAME] presses and holds b button (I feel you op)
10	You can't talk morality to psychopaths.
26	I was waiting for that but this isn't r/nononono or r/Holdmybeer
4	I know from personal experience that that can be the end of any good relationship.
4	Yes. Wait until recreational marijuana is legalised federally. Portugal could legalize all drugs including cocaine, but they are a small country.
20	In the Garden of Femininity, of course!
0	This is the most perfect , and fitting meme in this sub
6	All sounds possible except the key, I can't see how it was missed in the first search. 
20	Ok, for the low price of $27.97 I will help you out.
20	All the time here! Say have kid an ex wife and there poof gone!
4	Not gonna lie, I'd be intrigued for sure. 
6	I cant decide if replacing it with an icecream cone would make it better or worse or incredibly worse and also cursed
9	That's the biggest annoyance I have with this sub the past year; how little people value [NAME]. I don't get it.
20	Yep i always say this. Absolutely best case scenario is a foul ball. If he puts it in play it's probably a dribbler.
21	yeah, i believe thats the only moving part in the whole device.
0	[NAME] isn't really that bad, he's also a cheaper option who [NAME] trusts.
20	I'd prefer her as an actual character
7	Where did you get that? Highest I‚Äôve found is Donagal at 23%.
21	That, but I also really think that [NAME] is going to be a top QB. Especially, if he progresses during his time as back up.
4	I'm just gonna take this as a metaphor for idiot units.
20	It's an mi5 threat to Ireland. Funny how [NAME] may wants to amend GFA the next day

0	Nice try, officer.
2	"Dog thinking ""shit this guy is crazy, better get out"""

18	Love takes work and commitment. If it's not worth the work it isn't love. Learned that one from my blood family.
18	I love [NAME], but this sounds like he‚Äôs claiming signing a 26 year old superstar is stupid. Come on.

8	I wish I could too.
4	This is absolutely the proper place to post this.
9	What dose are you taking and how long did it take to help? I've been trying the Lazarus 50mg/ml. Not seeing any obvious improvement so far.

9	Well sure his one appearance in relief lost us a game, but at least he didn‚Äôt get hurt.

20	Grace and frankie
20	the scarf look cumbersome and heavy for her frame.
4	I know Bro! Won't happen again next Jan-uary.
4	Because most shit right wingers say is so awful that if they said it in a space where they weren't anonymous they would be fucking done
15	This really comforted me. Like genuinely. Thank you so much. You seem like a truly amazing person.
17	Which was in 2017. Enjoy your loss and shush. You'd think having 1 win in a month would humble you...

3	Must've been hard to resist, although the joke would've felt flaccid since it hangs so low
20	Manipulation of a persons enviorment while denying they are doing it in order to make the victim appear crazy.

27	lol since when do you have to go to a orientation?
0	Ideal situation. I just don't instead why fans are writing him off. He's a beast.
20	He‚Äôs actually a ghost. He died of that flu and his ghost is still cursed with the symptoms to this day.
1	Yeah that is the consensus I got for sure. Looking for a new place to live lol
4	It doesn't make you horny it just gives you a boner.
21	I'm yet to see the 2nd protect the rest of the constitution.
20	a partner of mine made it -- it's just about my favorite meme ever
18	I‚Äôd love to flatten [NAME] emotions.
0	Oh my. Bless this dog. He is a big boy. I love him so much. Tell him I love him.
20	Mine was apparently [NAME] and the giant peach!
10	He's just a money grabbing midget
2	Oh look, it's wr2! *proceeds to get fucked*
4	Thanks. And wow! Nice burn.
20	What happened that she was so pissed and did this live?
10	It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!
20	So are some women. A couple of my friends have this very issue.
20	Me too. :(
20	Cant you tell how sad she is from her face?
11	Thanks I hate it.
20	Tired of watching [NAME] choke, hope she's better in the deciding doubles 
9	[NAME] didn't finish the LPs!? Wow. I am in episode 20 something and was expecting him to finish :(
18	I think this is my favourite story of the year so far.
2	How can they tell if someone is a conservative? It's not like most of us go around wearing MAGA hats and Thomas Sowell patches on leather jackets.
10	I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm my opinion it isn‚Äôt sweet. 
11	I thought for a moment the one mongoose was dead after watching the other one drag it.

20	great for on the go! but i‚Äôll always smoke glass if i‚Äôm home :)
18	Right. I‚Äôm surprised everyone thinks he‚Äôs so cute...
14	All of season 6 is terrible
0	Most of his overtly sexual posts give me that vibe...they seem exploitative and as just another way to prove he owns her
20	Omg I forgot which is good ü§Æ. This almost topped the steak in the butt cheeks. Almost ‚òùÔ∏è
20	You're asking for scientific proof of spirituality. You're either very dumb, trolling, or you think I'm a charlatan.
4	Call it an ATATM (automatic teller ATM)

10	I guess some people just hate fun, lol
9	Oh no I didn‚Äôt see that episode!? She pooped in the car?!
14	I know. Maybe if they realize this, they'll stop using that app.
10	It shouldn't be, I feel like that's happened to us many times! 
0	This is my favorite game of all time. Thanks for bringing back some good memories!
21	[NAME] won it last year, even with all our goal kickers. Didn't think it would happen again with our set up.
20	Interesting note about the QR codes. I've almost never used them myself. I tend to just copy and paste an address.
3	I wouldn't be surprised if their confidence is so shot that they lose this control and lose 3-0
20	Losing to get draft picks doesn‚Äôt work as well as you think. A lot more goes into winning than getting a top 5 pick
4	I‚Äôm really starting to like that kid
25	He sounded so disappointed when he realized they just wanted sex :( Poor OP!
8	Could do even better by kicking out anything north of Cambridge or west of Oxford.
10	Unpopular opinion: I'd rather the team signed 26-year-old [NAME] over 30-year-old [NAME] coming off another leg injury.
27	Oh I know just bantz
20	Devils Advocate - Didn't the cringe-worthy Nike ad end up benefitting them in the long run?
23	If that‚Äôs not a joke it is a startling failure to notice one of the most interesting character arcs in the story
26	I'm in a similar boat, had surgery to correct Pectus Excavatum when in 2011, also 18 now, also deal with constant chronic pain.
3	The ridiculous hypocrisy of the far left has nothing to do with your link.
21	You can do it, I believe in you! 
20	It‚Äôs ok. We forgive you
21	Well hopefully we‚Äôll find out how hard her life was tonight ‚ò∫Ô∏è
20	[NAME] has an actual Fire Emblem channel and his fanbase plays Fire Emblem and Fire Emblem Heroes. That's a pretty big difference.
10	one quick glance at your comment history negates any value in this comment
23	I was about to explain that the one with 8 h's was taken until I read your username. Beautiful.
6	I don't know how accurate that is, pure nicotine is a lot different to nicotine in tobacco so I doubt vaping is that addictive
15	Yeah - we never had a fight. I'm glad we managed to end it in good terms. Thanks a lot for the sentiment, mate. Cheers!
20	with his luxurious salary, nice pension and zero accountability for anything it does, its a hard old life!!!
2	Is that because it's an accurate description of the politician and he's trying to distract from his guilt?
13	I've tried this and I chipped my tooth on the tiny fork cause I'm used to plastic lol!!! I'm a mess
21	......man Shes a decent candidate. But [NAME] is better. Well see. Lets hope for a legit primary.

23	You know it wasn't missionary, if she wanted it that bad she was most likely doing all the work.
4	You are normal. Very normal.
26	Someone will actually spend their money on this too, that‚Äôs the sad part
1	Actually looks really fucking fun. Where can I do this?
20	Show down there heretic. You obviously meant to say: Unquestionable truth, any diversion from what seems to be true only comes from our own limitations. /s
20	Not very choosing beggars-ish, but definitely entitled parents material. Did she really just say that to you? Cuz you can call her out for verbal assault.
3	"She also spoke out quite angrily about ""Obamacare"" until she needed it due to her high risk pregnancy. She's remarkably hypocritical."
20	Don't wo
4	Yes he knew the child was his. I was living with him the entire time and we were constantly together.
26	I've got no place else to go...
4	Start an initiative to take away cops guns since you feel so strongly about it
15	They seem to be about 1/2 the price anyone else has quoted me, so it`s a good place to start, thank you!
20	inertial frame of reference is the viewing party.
15	Lol this was cosmetic. Thankfully both of mine are alive and well.

11	I tried to quit smoking it only lasted 1 month but nofap I did for almost 2 years
17	[NAME] damn, that is the kind of biting commentary I enjoy.
0	Amazing. Perfect ending.
20	Gotta think [NAME] was also tired after all the hard work they put out Most likely it'd be easier for a fresh player to run passed players
20	Oh man, dream date right there. Zoo then sushi?? Yes please. 
20	Even in Star Trek they have $, they just dont really talk about it. The point is basic needs are so trivial
27	No, he said he's bringing in somewhere around 10K a month, not 2500 a month. That's a HUGE income gap.
4	Former HUD secretary? I'll bet he'd make a hell of a brain surgeon.
12	Whoops!! I totally didn‚Äôt realize ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4	yes it does.

26	Another bad essay by me, sorry for butchering anarchism, anti-ableism and anti-psychiatry but I hope I got the point across :p

4	I guessed that but I‚Äôve never seen a bun like that
26	Awe, poor baby. 
25	Well unless you have an audio recording, people are gonna struggle to diagnose it for you any further I‚Äôm sorry. 
20	But he did...at the end of last year and this season.... And I‚Äôll take Mayfields word over speculation
6	What? I am aware it isn't permanent. The other legals aren't permanent either.
23	I didn't realize there was ever an initial post on this subject.
20	Now she just needs to put start stealing hams and then if they ask she can show her stump and she will get away with it

6	Do you still have the video?

20	Boooo!!
20	I do have a feeling [NAME] will retire while [NAME] still has a season on his contract.

18	it looks like she took it in a totally different direction which i‚Äôm loving
20	Had one of those in Penticton when I was a kid too.

20	Do you always assign people positions they don't hold to avoid accountability for being a failure? Or is this a recent development?

26	I was tested for the flu on Saturday and it came back negative, but yea it probably is a cold or something

1	You keep turning it into all or nothing lol I said *less* bookshelves will be made if *more* bookshelves are reused

4	Emotes have a ridiculous amount of effort put into them, which only makes the fact that nobody uses them sadder
23	Most of the people on top aren't even very relevant anymore, at least not nearly as relevant as they used to be

17	Happy New Year! Let's smash 2019!
20	[NAME] was quite anti-Semitic.
21	You were really fortunate! See, that‚Äôs what I imagined would happen...

4	I can totally see it. I‚Äôd be very interested to see them interact.
3	You cant love this girl if she already has a GF whom she sounds like she loves. You'll just ruin a relationship

26	Indeed! Oh [NAME], you are in for a horrible life...

1	Gotta cheat on taxes somehow LOL
4	Pretend it's a multiplication table. Memorize a bit at a time.
5	The Supreme Court has already ruled the police have no obligation to protect you. They are there to enforce laws.

3	Just split for gods sake before kids are born.
15	I love your comment...
0	I think [NAME] said it best. When two people watch the same video and see completely different events....there's no fixing that.

15	Thanks, this means a lot! I will do don't worry :)
0	Well done dude! Seriously :) But keep it up, don't lose this momentum.
20	Fried Egg is my #1 since cricket cafe stopped doing breakfast sandwiches.
3	Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he‚Äôs only now feeling the consequences of his actions
7	What is it again?
20	I work on a farm. I can confirm can be dangerous. I have a hard time imagining a scenario where being a cop is more dangerous.
20	Looks deliriously boring.
17	I like to believe he faked his own death, so he can enjoy his many Bitcoin coins and wealth.

8	I feel like I say this a lot but I wish we'd run the mudiay frank back court more, I like their chemistry together
1	Remember they are an ex for a reason. Seeing that smile probably made you remember all the happy times
7	How is the JC-01 with juul pods. I've heard mixed reviews.
20	Odd to think that most people in this photo are either dead or just about into pension age.
4	I schedule reading breaks during the day. It allows me time to relax if I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed, but is still beneficial for the kids. 
23	Oh, did you not know [NAME] is the highest graded overall passrusher in this class? At any position!
17	Lucky for me the yellow ones are my favourite

20	Name and shame
3	Well yeah, you've gotta paint it white yourselves
13	Wow, automated can collection is news in 2019? Literally have done this for a decade minimum...
3	I can't help but agree with the headline at the bottom, bright side (the YouTube channel) is annoying.

1	üòÖ sorry. Lol
2	Stop using your corporate jargon around here!
0	Looks like goodfellow
26	Uh, sorry. We're under trumpcare now.
