2	Ok. Hang onto shit you can't change and be whiney about it. This is a reason why we catch shit. We can't take it
10	No need to apologize. It definitely put things in perspective. I’m just glad your DD ended up ok.
21	Don't worry, you'll find love, I promise! I hope you love yourself as well. <3
23	Kinda reminds me of Arctic Monkeys' 'Favourite Worst Nightmare' cover art
7	I'm curious - are you under the age of 30?
3	Oh cool another manufactured awful [NAME] pushing untalented rapper. It’s getting more obvious as time goes by
20	I’m sorta okay with the chicken but the sauce part is downright chaotic
18	Drop it off at a tent city or homeless camp. I've done it with an old Adirondak chair and they seemed to love it.
4	[NAME] YES!!!
20	Women aren’t men. We don’t need multiple sexual partners the way men do.
3	Poeling is looking like a fkn stud. Imagine our C depth next season... [NAME]... holy fuck
18	Truer words were never typed. Loved that game.
20	Sorrow. Sorrow.
15	Seconded! [NAME] is gorgeous.
20	But then you missed their officiant who looks and sounds like [NAME]! 🤭😳🤣 
20	And then they claim that being incels have nothing to do with their personalities.
5	You're not from America, are you? Bless your pure soul <3 
20	No idea man. Go check that one “study” done thirty years ago where you got that 40% from.
4	It is his welcome, he can do with it as he wishes. Your misunderstanding is forgiven.
20	Actually it can be useful when 2 people or so use the carbine for crowd control .
7	yeah i want to see what kind of car it is post pics :)
3	Well I’m hyped.
3	He said i am being rude to her
20	[NAME] gets eliminated the 3rd time she's in the bottom so this is wrong and [NAME] would have the best track record if this is true
20	"Result of ""I have camera so I'm invincible"" syndrome."
10	Maybe unpopular but I never eat pancakes with syrup. Way too damn sweet.
20	>Feminism is how we get to equality how do you know that?
23	I thought the sane until I got threatening emails from HR
20	He had been so worried that the stepmom would have a hard time integrating into the family.
6	Was hoping for a per bear on the other side, or maybe a running woodchipper.
20	Sweet [NAME] of Haiti..it does! I no longer burn paperwork like I used to, and *I* can see it. EDIT: Hermes-talk
18	This is my bestie's favorite song.
2	Great fucking game for [NAME]. And I can't believe some people are trying to hate on him for one TOV in the 4th. This fan base smh
18	This was so touching ❤️❤️❤️
5	Why are we making fun of a little kid? He probably hasnt even the ability to grow a neckbeard yet.
21	I hope you like it-
10	Don't listen to much prog or hardcore, I love some black metal though.
0	I had hot dogs. They were delicious, lol!
7	They‘re not together? Looks like I have some serious scrolling to catch up on!!

18	"""[NAME], meet [NAME]"" love that show"
15	Thanks for sharing :)

2	(*ﾉωﾉ) O-okay senpai OWO *Nuzzles* Frick off I write whatever I want!

0	This is gold!!!!! Im impressed. Very accurate.
8	Professionally.... no way I could do that to myself
21	I got into law school, and now I’m finally tackling my addiction to video games to make sure I graduate :) 
20	Nice try Lumi
15	Hey, thanks for clarifying. I was trying to find news online without any luck.
1	You played yourself
20	Insta/fastmine scam, but yeah, scam none the less.
7	Om [NAME], who kets their dog fight a croc? 
23	Well, flash bangs go bang, too, to temporarily deafen and disorient, so there's that.
7	Cool shot. Super wide angle, multi shot?
9	He was in the merge lane and should have yielded. He was legally in the wrong.
20	Actually someone already said goodbye so checkmate idiot
20	I haven't seen it but it's on my list!!
7	wait. So most of south asia doesn't eat rice?
23	They do, however this is a TRAFFIC unit that focus' on TRAFFIC offences. Ice dealers are more of a detective / taskforce job.
0	That’s awesome. They did it on purpose.
20	I actually have to try, to see what happens
3	"""Being able to attract women"" shouldn't be the only way you rate how good a person is. That's ridiculous."
3	Oy! NOW THAT'S REALLY PISSED IT OFF!!
0	With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn’t be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
20	Nope. Are we at the name calling stage? And here I thought we were getting along.
4	True. I think the only way vegan lab-grown meat could be produced is via self-renewing stem cells which is still a very undeveloped technology
20	Is [NAME] somewhere on Apple Music? I can’t find her
9	The reaction is incredible. I’m quite certain it’s satire as well, but its impact is depressing as hell. 
5	ELABORATE plz!!!!
3	Who tf told you that weirdo is left?
4	I thought it got a nerf when the spirit got released. My bad. But I still stand by, healing against the legion is pointless. 
20	Protip: you probably meant that you COULDN'T care less.
25	And I've no monkeys left.... Sorry man
6	> What plans should I use to hide the scent of a decaying body? Can you bottle up his farts? Seriously.
10	"I just hate the ""I don't know"" people"
4	Yeah agreed, it’s great to see!
0	Wow it looks like we held our own negotiating here, nice to see.
16	Even today, many years later that still gives me chills. RIP.
11	[NAME] isn't secretly homophobic he is openly homophobic
11	nah.....anime is weird
6	Is that meat or veggies?
15	Thanks for keep us posted

17	Abortion. emails. BENGHAZI! red cups Happy Holidays
4	Yeah I know a lot of people fail to realize it or at least right away
6	So you're male then. Ps ur wrong bud
2	Sue the shit out of her for damages to your private property.
20	"That's why I said ""much"" instead of ""most"" ... 70 is still 5 over 65."
20	Ice in his veins... D'L❄
19	No no! I meant it in a positive way. The emotional rollercoaster of the photo album.
20	It looks like a quail egg and it’s actually on a plate a weird looking plate but still a plate.
8	I hope not, i was just sharing what happened to my bud. GL man, hope you get it figured out
20	Someone who's done very little to earn your ire. Did I piss in your cornflakes?
4	I like this one
26	[NAME] is getting very unhinged I almost feel bad for him at this point
20	Send it!
0	I appreciate your honesty.
26	Sad/Sweet for her to put in the effort to fake it!
17	This South Florida girl loves Jaxons Ice Cream. Seeing the kitchen sink makes me want to drive home.
8	To be fair, spinners are supposed to be very small pornstars, not BBW like trump.
20	That kid comes out of nowhere, it looks like he appeared right next to the woman like he teleported. 
10	I dont think she knows that once your body runs out of fat it starts eating your muscles and organs.
20	Couldnt find this one in google, where abouts is it?
3	Oh, [NAME], don't bring THAT story up!
1	She was sorry too, after I found out and ripped her a new one. LOL
20	This only makes me want him more. Proves he is decisive and has self belief. Our team has been devoid of both.
3	Ur mom causes a 2.6 just getting out of bed in the morning amirite?
23	And evidently [NAME] has a weak stomach. Ha.
27	Oh look a player breaking out of a slump against Dallas. Haven't seen this one before
20	"Verify yourself already or we will continue to ""spit negativity"""
0	Shes stunning haha
0	This is the single most wholesome thing I've seen on reddit. Proud.
9	This was diabolical. This is our Ulema. Wonder where we went wrong...

1	You must be fun at parties
13	soon i’ll have an army of karens and no one will be able to stop me

20	ROLL THE DICE
26	BPA not fit especially when we dont have a good team
20	[NAME] for comments on matches.
3	Oh man, you got me there with the image
0	This would be better posed in r/GCdebatesQT, thank you.
7	> so I would never say that to someone *To* someone, or *about* someone?
1	This is honestly the cherry on top of the cake with this story. That's absolutely hilarious!
20	Ah that's my school but I have yet to see this one, gotta keep swippin 
27	I'm rank 6 and get destroyed for using legion, what build do you use? I absolutely love legion just here getting ran over
9	Because it's straight up untrue. It's a new ce idea but anyone relying on the sentiment is going to be repeatedly disappointed.
3	They ate not hot, they are just annoyingly humid.
4	When you live where it's this cold, incessant complaining is a national pass time.
5	In the least condescending way possible I think you have some gross misconceptions and I'd like to clear them up.
9	Jolex because [NAME] grated on my nerves so bad
20	Do women make the razor blade choices for their spouses? I guess they could aim for that demographic.
15	I'm so glad I grew up playing a shooter made for kids rather than a shooter made for kids.
5	I have a long term plan. I appreciate the concern.
0	This is awesome! do you have any more artwork on a website or social site? Is this for sale!?
5	Get your mom professional help. Any grow person who runs away from their own home afterargument definitely has mental health issues

15	Thanks! I ordered some and let them know I'm traveling so I think I'm pretty set
18	I loooooove Tiff!!!
0	Man that movie is such a classic
10	I would enjoy this if it had a few more pixels.
20	Cheers mate.
24	We don't care as much for 69. Hard to do properly. Glad it works for you. We prefer to take turns.
0	[NAME], with his 8th appearance he's the most veteran player there
5	I'd be able to give you more helpful advice if you could be a little more clear with your situation and what you're asking.
27	Wow the [NAME] replies appeared in less than ten minutes this time!
3	Ok you're a little homophobic
20	Give the mouse a chance!.leave the cat to it.
0	I both loathe and applaud you
0	There are [NAME] fans on this subreddit. Awesome
11	Woke up feeling smug that I am off until Wednesday... Then I saw all the text messages, emails, and Skype messages. Fuuuuuuck. 
20	/uj I would've thought this was pics had it not been for your commie t
7	So sad—but not surprising. It would be interesting to know if there’s a difference between countries with and without socialised health care.
24	No worries. Just giving you a hard time!
10	A lawyer is not going to disclose anything to random users, you guys are delusional
10	imagine if this was [NAME] people would lose their shit
10	She does have a great ass I’ve always thought so
6	Why is it shocking? All professional sports is all about bottom line first-period!
10	Wait that... that doesn’t happen
10	"Thats not him :( the most recent comment literally starts with ""i'm not a dude"" "
4	Very well said.
3	SJW's I've encountered were far more trivial and spiteful in general.
14	Don’t worry! I was never convicted of anything!
0	Ooh, the pupil proportion was wonderful at this time.
26	If I have to watch Canada lose in a shootout I'm gonna lose it
20	It makes me wonder if Old Money New England families are into their own cousins a bit much.
6	Hey, [NAME]. You still with the mafia?
4	I know, that's why it's a little unfortunate they don't have a test. 
20	Right now I live in a medium sized one but I have lived in a big city for a couple of years.
11	This is nasty NSFW
20	Probably an old dude.
17	Inkling main: I like being cheap. It makes me happy.
15	On being 3x over the speed limit while under the influence, that alone makes him very guilty of something wrong. Thanks for the additional information.
1	Lol I wish
2	I'm just concerned about [NAME] health. Do you think an old, ugly, fat, stupid person like him should be eating such unhealthy meals?
20	They're living their fantasy.
1	I wake up and think I have to go to school and then realize I've graduated and I'm going to work
10	Iirc she's alive but an alcoholic.
4	We have outlets with timers in every parking spot of all households in Finland.
4	This is the reason why I don't have friends. Not even skinny ones, you never know how they will be in the furure
6	Which subcommittee?
20	wtf is 190/140 bp type stuff
20	If you think steamed hams is unexpected anywhere on Reddit, then I got news for you
20	Somebody please make sure Catman doesn’t freeze to death? Thanks
5	Thanks for clarifying; I've never heard this (it's not a pejorative where I live) so it's good to know.
20	But did [NAME] watch sports bra test videos when he was picking out fernandas ^boobies
3	Dregs of society still the dregs of society shocker.
1	Haha penis.
14	I get all the deja smells and it's terrible.
8	Be great if the DV judge made her refund the cash to every single person, unlikely, but I can fantasize:(
20	Nah dude, it's religious.
2	I have a feeling you're one of those far rightist trump supporters trying to use [NAME]. Your uncaring, almost sociopathic idealogies make me sick.
7	Surprise my what now?
20	I’ve always thought he was overrated until now
20	That's ironic. Because [NAME] isn't getting the Wall funded, we are pulling more resources off the border blockade effort?
2	How is this the epitome of slavery? Nobody is forcing you to do this. Stop being dramatic.
15	Love [NAME]! MAGA and [NAME]! [NAME]! But this is not helping....
1	i love how the caption implies that the only unrealistic thing/ the only thing that gives away the photoshop is the sleeve lol
20	Again, overall, not just for me. 
1	Lol ahh man this made me laugh so hard. That filled my laugh gauge for the day.
16	What a trainwreck
19	Damn....
20	Best sports league in the world.
17	This is amazing. This is how Christmas should be.
9	That is odd.
13	My biggest pet peeve is blown saves.
4	I'm sorry, but this has also caught my attention and I kinda want to see this screenplay.
20	Going by it's [NAME] rating though, the district should be leaning blue. 
20	>It is tailored to your viewing history. That's fairly common knowledge nowadays isn't it? Weird thing for the comic to point out.
9	Ok cheers. I’m banned from there
13	Totally here for [NAME] and [NAME] boxing [NAME] in before he even announces
22	And the apartment is clean! You can see the floor!
20	Do you agree that voter literacy exams and grandfather clause in post civil war USA were de jure racial-blind but de facto racist?
4	Someone commented that it's like that friend who constantly talks about their ex, but insist they're over them.
8	I’m just waiting for love
20	Not under [NAME]. Under [NAME] desperate greedy extreme partisan coward politics. They purposely brought racism front and center.
0	[NAME]!! Awesome!! He's the only one that i have anything signed by
7	Can you adopt me? I’m after those bones
2	Snatched her up with the quickness
20	Matinee games should not be allowed for us anymore, we’re terrible at matinee games
2	[NAME] is not good enough to get that angry.
20	That's kind of the problem innit? The only solution is for everyone to do something that we all damn well know everyone isn't going to do.
13	Congratulations on securing your CF Future!!!
7	Did you really upload a video you took, of your own cat, to whyweretheyfilming? Seriously?
1	It feels oddly comforting and familiar that we suck at hockey again.
20	Yeah of the business. That’s how I’d word it idk maybe that’s wrong
1	Then enjoy your shutdown!
10	[NAME] got a bad report card from [NAME] as well today.
0	This is how far the Broncos have fallen. They no longer command the best and the brightest. Now it's .500 retreads. This should be concerning.
0	He has a youtube: Great watch.
9	Emo!!
1	but you won't hear that from most of the press or people on this sub WHAT IS THEIR POLICY THOUGH lmao
4	"""The first step, is to put on a set of vicious stilleto claws. This doesn't make things any easier, but it does build character"""
20	I know plenty of [NAME] that look down on 中国人 Like they’ve forgotten the whole reason Singapore exists
20	Sure you can, but the question is whether or not the kid will listen, or if you will upset the parent. 
10	that was an ugly 5v3
4	Good [NAME], you are right.
20	Or is that a 3:14? You’re in trouble pal.
20	i got [NAME] a bit of a long shot but i see why
0	Unfamiliar with **[NAME] neighbours** Still I live at least 75' from 2 very nice quiet and respectable peeps.
19	The EU's 'red lines' are in treaty and legislation. The UK's red lines are just May's opinions, they could disappear in two minutes.
5	I bet you're not the only one. That space is kinda safe... go be slightly challenging. ;)
19	I’ve massively improved but it never really gets cured. There are always situations that will give you anxiety.
20	Haven't printed a retraction in twenty years!
20	Yard goats was awesome. Almost a major league feel to it when it’s a packed day
20	Ah, that's why they say don't run in the corridor
4	"I was just about to comment this. Pause in between ""but"" and ""why"" too"
2	What a complete and utter cunt.
6	I guess that was a compromise with that native sarong that he likes to wear.
14	I hope all my muscles cringe so spastically all my joints come loose and I collapse into a writhing agonized pile of blood and meat.
1	haha. I think he means this in a good way. Just poorly verbalized.
3	But in the end, it doesn’t even matter
0	I think you have a terrible opinion. Now that we agree on something though this could be the start of a beautiful friendship!
20	Huh, assumed he was more of a grindr fella .....
20	As far as I can tell, but her religion does seem to influence her practice 
15	Thanks a bunch <3
4	Feeling bit better now, but the feeling as a whole will come back I know.
0	[NAME] is super happy. Nice.
3	Yes!!!!!! She’s a hot mess!
15	Great, thanks :) remember, just let it go!
1	You sound like a creep dude
1	Lol it was a joke. Meta from r/askreddit
17	This is amazing
10	[NAME] is not fascist. Heck,she's not even alt-right
0	I don't know who [NAME] is but you're killin it in that sweater!
0	The design was interesting. But it had a lot of flaws
3	Completely miss-wired! I never thought a kid can grow up miss-wired.
10	Yeah, however you spell it - I don’t play with them 
23	I can’t see many players having a problem with [NAME] being gone. Sometimes a coaching change can create the jump start this team needs.
27	I wonder if we will get to actually see the demise of their relationship. I doubt they will do it on the show though.
21	They didn’t take it; you abandoned it. A TSA agent clarified that for me once. I hope you can replace it easily.
20	They both crazy
6	She looks like a televangelist.
20	"Teacher: ""ok guys, put your phones down (and definitely don't send me the link)"""
9	Didn't mean to offend
2	Which means it isnt his fault? And the 4th? What the fuck was he supposed to do. stop blaming 1 player.
13	Their album is awesome, too.
3	The comments under that video are disturbing. People actually see this as a sign of the end of times.
3	[NAME] is a creeper and hangs out with underage girls n shit.
10	Instagram is the only one to blame for all this evil
20	lol out loud
20	Please tell me she has a partner named [NAME]
20	He'd have to ask his mom
20	This guy doesn’t like fox hunting because “toffs” do it. As with all policies of the left, it’s grounded in jealousy. 
5	Try harder next time <3
5	I'm glad you got the help you needed. Sorry we couldn't help you here.
21	Nice try coppers.
4	I think, call before you come and limit it to an hour is reasonable if you have relatives that need to be told that. 
2	WHAT?! You dare insult the band of gods?! Typical teen, I hate my own generation! *screams in 16 year old*
26	Missing this roster 😢😢😢
18	I love reading anti gentrification comments. Because they always sound so stupid.
2	You asked if I verified. You set the goal post, not me.
20	Stop the speed. It does that to you
4	I like [NAME], but I'd just rather spend more time with [NAME].
1	This guy's an idiot lol
1	Please keep making them mad
20	Don't worry, it's the internet so that angle has already been well covered: 
12	Also his weird spiked haircut. I wanted spiked hair when I was like 6. I also wanted a mohawk. I'm not 6 anymore.
4	I've long completed everything I can and spent all my fight money. No Kage for me
20	ive had a gedmatch account since 2012, i was just commenting that 23andme hadn't given me any more specific results than it had previously 
10	Yup, not enough money
27	Oh yea [NAME] from Danganronpa 1 is great too, a cute hacker girl and one of my fave charas from the franchise! ✨
2	i hate u...
21	"I didn't know that kind of ""full-tang"" existed. Good to know. "
20	Not that poster, but huh, 
21	Cool. I wish I could come to anarchopulco this year. Have fun.
20	A stunning place, you will need lots of cuddles to stay warm though!
0	Good on your manager for having your back as well
0	Makes me want to break out my 'learn to use my SLR properly' resolution again.. more time commitment tbh. Great shot.
20	the rubber coming off is always a problem
10	You have no recourse. You can always start your own fb group if you'd like.
1	I found [NAME]!! That took me way too long to spot the watermark lol. Good eye!!
15	They don’t have that on iOS unfortunately 😭 but thank you for the suggestion!
24	[NAME] can’t hurt us anymore.
20	I was trying to make a friend that was being a douche jealous by telling him I was having a 3 some. Accidentally messaged it to my father.
20	Oh boy yeah
27	omg what a nightmare, I feel for you 😞 is there any way you could order it online?
20	Hit up skull forts if you are looking for the fastest way. But just play and have fun.
20	Shame [NAME] is no longer with us
20	Didn't know they were doing matches on smaller pitch in the combine to see how they do with less reaction time. Thought that was interesting.
20	Personally, I adore capitalism. But that's just me. 
2	The Netflix documentary about [NAME] absolutely sucks. Don't waste your time.
1	When asked about my hopes for the Wild, i always (half) jokingly say, “i hope my grandkids can see them raise their first Cup”
15	Another thank you, this is great info.
20	Probably end of February and all of March before release. I think that's what they did last year
4	Congrats keep going
21	Too many injuries. I predict he will be off the roster by September.
9	Yeah that is a pretty crap and unhelpful thing to say, especially coming from someone who works in that job. 
10	No I didn’t think that, it was the way the information was presented
1	I enjoy shouting this at my husband and our friends when they're being especially nerdy.
18	"I absolutely love that idea ""BuT a CoP tOlD mE"""
20	Uh eat less than you burn per day. Eat a lot of protein.
20	You got a friend in meeeee...
0	Interesting what you said about the crew and better to fly solo than with people who bring you down. I'll remember that.
20	I like where you’re going with this....
20	Lol, and be sure to slam the door real hard when you leave.
2	Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.
12	"It makes for awkward conversation when I ask ""What's your favorite song?"" And I get ""I just liked the shirt"" in response"
20	Damn right.
20	I bet she smells like a jar of mayo left open for a week in the summer
5	Keep on hmmm-ing toots. Maybe you’ll put yourself to sleep
7	Cheers, brother. What are you doing to meet women? 
20	Human life has value. Veganism and pro-life are 2 completely different ballparks morally. Terrible argument 1/10
20	Idk I felt like that until I got diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease.
20	You can be highly educated and still incredibly ignorant.
7	>They split up 5 years later after an extremely messy situation with Dr [NAME]. Very very long story. I would like to hear this story
22	Don’t worry I gave him silver
10	“The weird thing is she’s got a tattoo of our company on her back...” lmfao
4	Prey actually had portals before Portal. Such an underrated game.

7	Didn’t they play a game earlier this season with both [NAME] and [NAME] out?
15	Thank you for your help my friend
4	I will admit,I did chuckle a bit
20	I see your point as well. I wasn’t the one complaining. I was supporting the one everyone was going after
17	Min Gung in Glastonbury also has all you can eat sushi. Always a good time!
20	Xers and [NAME] would be more of age in the 90’s doh, signed [NAME].

23	I'm just going to do what r/soccer done over Christmas and take it off.
15	Explaines Why I’m on the lookout for cats when I’m anxious! Thanks
20	Dang something actually useful rather than a skin we won't use cuz we already have Belzebub

7	WHAT!? *I thought you were a local!?*
4	Didn't even knew that was a thing, eitherway it would be nice to have a back up page just in case

3	That is insane
20	Are we not going to discuss the fact that his head is forming from the top of his ear
1	Hahaha I wish I was that witty at the time, I think I was still in naive shock at the rudeness of people in retail. 
20	Let's go!
13	And that is what cognitive dissonance looks like. People do the craziest things when reality doesn't meet their expectations.
20	Let’s actually go
4	I think he is dead but he died long before the supposed raid. He was old and sick, dying of kidney failure.
6	I can’t figure out how to PM you but I have a question about something on another post. Mom of 2 here. 😂
1	I mean a blowout isn’t really enjoyable.
17	"I'm 5'6"" and three quarters haha. Have hair though."

9	[NAME] would be really pissed off to lose c3po and r2 to the fucking destroy ending
11	pretty much correct except for when right wingers get triggered they type on a keyboard and when leftists get triggered they try and ruin the career of whatever offended them
11	Pretty shit tbh with you
4	If an addict gets clean of booze/drugs, you congratulate them! What a horrible crabbycrab to try to shut down someone who got their addiction under control.
20	"he said the victims who survivied ""pushed a fat person in front of the shooter"" yeah that really 'making fun of bad ideas' "
9	Both. I have a feeling that broth was ruined a long time ago, in a footballers bedroom not so far away.
4	I’ll agree with you on that, I think it would fit well on someone’s forearm! 
1	That is great insight. Once mom is against you, you’re done. 
20	Was thinking the same. But watching the fight, one time def had it
20	I know I would take a [NAME] with his numbers any day of the week regardless of how many of his points are secondary.
4	"The grey shirt guy: ""Oh shoot! I leave the stove on!"""

27	I'm surprised that the police have not send her to a mental institution
26	Sorry. Bad day.
20	Only the [NAME] do so. The rest of us have been exasperated with him for months, at least.

7	Ah the infamous [NAME]. How I've suppressed that name from my memory.... Until now

3	Fool me once, shame on you...
20	Morality whilst trying not to destroy their future clients trust.
5	Your mental health matters the most. You can't help him more than you do, but you can help yourself. 
4	When you start correcting spelling and grammar you lose automatically my dude. Your points stand by themselves. Being an English teacher just makes you look like a jackass
1	My dog is less uglier than this.
18	I liked it better when [NAME] was half naked
3	I wish I could help you but I’m in the same ditch as you. High school is causing me troubles too
10	I don't like it, simply because men never want to be just friends, and I have no interest in dating random dudes who message me.
20	Indian : Malai kofta at Bombay house Also Balaji Caffe in West Jordan for some authentic South Indian fare
5	Him being in prison (if these useless people and their story is real) HIV and Hep C should be a concern for her.
22	Wah, the poor dead fascist thug! What a fucking tragedy. Every dead cop makes the world a safer place.

5	You really need to learn to read. 32 isn't too late!
4	Wait what’s wrong with [NAME] lol I’ve never had any problems listening to him personally
18	Point is, you’ll have to come clean. Sooner rather than later. And if she loves you, she can forgive you. 
20	This would be like switching from a girlfriend who cheats on you and steals your money to a girlfriend who cheats on you and doesn't like your dog.
2	">The Charisma Myth"" It's bullshit too."

1	Buncha people having (admittedly loud) fun. Don’t really see the issue.
1	Thanks hehe hit me up on there sometime!

1	Hahah is that what we call them here? Breeders? I'm not trying to be condescending that's just hilarious.
13	All we need is 1 more Trae three and the W and this’ll be a great night

1	> People who aren’t stupid don’t get offended when Called stupid. Exactly. Well put. Thanks.
20	Would any gathering of the Knights of Ren count? Or would they have to officially organize a thing.

3	Better to spend the weekend in jail than get convicted of something you didn't do.
21	yup it may be me!
20	Confusingly, they also want less rights for [NAME].
20	Maybe I'm out of the loop, can we get a little more detail please?
9	Poor attempt for karma I think

17	They're just excited! About everything!! It's the best when people do this in professional emails, too!!! 
20	> you've absolutely just generically described absolutely everywhere and not just Scotland. Nope, just the difference between scotland and sussex is staggering. 
20	Yeah but she didn’t get anybody to vote for anyone. She said they all said they were voting for [NAME] anyway.
7	I see her reply back to comments all the time 😑
20	His DBPM as well as his OBPM is better than Embiid's
2	Anyone who fell for the Lonzo hype from the beginning should slap themselves.
2	Your wife just proved to your son that her love for him is not unconditional. She sounds ignorant, hateful, and should get therapy or get out.
3	> Society usually paints men as emotionless, cold, and self sustaining creatures who don't need affection. Not really, though.

2	Classic sloth fuckboi
0	I would be impressed if [NAME] ate 15% of his weight every day I wish I lived in a state where the contest was valid. Stupid NY

0	I like how his actual clone comes running up to him to congratulate him on that recovery
4	She should not defend herself? Stop blaming both sides.
0	I’ve made the same exact comment before It’s mind boggling
1	"Yeah. ""HEY ARE YOU THE DUDE FROM THE SCAM WEBSITE?"" [NAME]"
13	As a non-religious that’s fascinated by [RELIGION], I love this 😅.
6	Maybe it's fantasy.....I just feel like the stock for a lot of these Ducks is reallllll low right now

20	SO MUCH.
0	He is actually good now. No teddy but he was great last year before he got into shit
23	After listening to the lecture, I’ve concluded that there’s no way this kid isn’t a redditor
10	[NAME] is cheaper too. If we would have kept [NAME] we would have had to extend him to over $4mil.
8	Really? How would they know what pharmacy you want to visit?
6	Found the militant long time Southwest employee? ...and if not, I am constantly amazed at what random people will get mad about these days.
20	The only power another has over you psychologically is that which you give to them.
18	I also love Dallas Observer's Concert Calendar by day:
9	"I can't stand [NAME]. Especially since her ""tatooing my own face"" video. "
20	Eòrapaidh for me 😉
14	That movie really scared me when I was a kid.
18	I really love how this team responds to injuries

7	What song was that earlier ? It went oooh oooh ooooh oooh oooh oooh.

7	You know what would instantly unwreck you? A good screwing. Transformational !
3	You’re looking at hard time mate
7	I'm curious!!! The likes of [NAME] and [NAME] may have been choices for me in another timeline. Who took names that you know of?
7	Can I get this as a flair
0	[NAME] forced [NAME] to give it up, leading to a steal, and then gets a steal himself on the next play. Love his tenacity.
20	Scratch that, tickets go on sale February 7th.
4	People who eat themselves to death are mentally ill in my opinion. Homicide is a deliberate and unlawful killing of a person by another person.
0	Bold of you to assume just about everyone here wouldn't do this for you, you absolute gem
6	Out of curiosity, did [NAME] mention autism?
10	This has nothing to do with weebs, anime, mlp, katana, or 4chan. This is just doesn't belong hear.

20	I just got the sarcasm of your post.
18	This is the sweetest.
15	Not at all. I wasn't offended in the least. Thanks for the promotion!
9	The TV anime series is, at least, atrociously bad and stupid. Is full of deus ex and silly cliffhangers.

20	wait wasn't r [NAME] the guy who enjoyed pissing on people?
8	I take showers at night and I desperately need one atm. My hair has been really greasy recently.

3	Stop master debating, you are making a fool out of yourself. It's concerning.
3	Unless he has actually threatened to or used them against you I think you're over reacting. Ask him to please delete them.

20	Please tell me you forgot the /s
12	You fruitcart, you oughta be ashamed of knowing that, let alone expecting anyone else to know.
20	I really wanted this to be a real sub.
20	I definitely wouldn’t do a role change at the tournament but definitely when they get home. I should’ve clarified that sry.
24	Dude, I can't express in words how much relief this man brings to my soul.
21	You didn't write that very clearly at all. I Wish You Would is a cover anyway, and I highly doubt that was the point of the tweet.
23	Last year preseason was in December, but the season started in January. I expect pre-season to occur some time during the second half of this month.
20	What’s this from? An aftershow or something?
20	Not as bad as the face [NAME] making
0	Me too. It’s my favorite. His cadence in saying it is so perfect lol.

4	If you’re downloading from windows I believe so
4	Dying like hero’s. What better way to die than saving the world. You’re right.
20	Sorry but the majority of console players will agree that he needs nerfed and nerfed hard

20	[NAME] just reminded us last night why he’s paid his ridiculous wages
10	Just keep it. You’re going to go through more brain damage than it’s worth.

10	This is probabaly going to be an unpopular opinion but I definitely think all police cars should be clearly marked, unless they're part of an undercover operation.
14	Kotaku never ceases to amaze me with the horrible decisions they make in posting stories that can ruin people's lives with no confirmation or validity.
4	I mean, yes. But in terms of real dollars, they will still pay a lot more taxes than before.
3	Why is this my fucking friend [NAME] 😂
20	Yes, listening to loud noises can damage your ears. Temporarily and permanently.
20	"""I SAID, [NAME]!"""

4	Honestly Quadriga has been pretty decent, can't fault them for the bank struggle, that's just how the Canadian banks have been towards this space. 
4	Bad execution but it made me smile through the cringe. The sentiment is definitely relatable.
14	You sound scared
20	When I see [NAME] venerate icons it makes you wonder if they have OCD. /s The joke is that [NAME] cross themselves more than others in my experience.
7	"You know the first thing they're going to ask ""so, are you hungry?"" "
10	Yeah, I don't think [NAME] supporters should use intelligence as a reason to talk down to people. I have watched [NAME] speak. Yikes.

27	Won't stop the BF from going to jail.
20	They did and he is going to be extremely difficult to feel much empathy for him.
2	The FDA has plenty to criticize. But like here, it's usually criticized horribly off base. It needs to grow some balls and actually enforce things. 
4	I understand. Just know that I'm here. I've been through hell and back. I am happy to listen to anything.
3	This is the kind of thing that makes me want to move away far into the mountains away from civilization.
12	The second overall pick is pretty embarrassing

9	It's not like an NFL coach would trip a player on the field if they had the opportunity......oh wait

20	^ Didn't read the article.
20	"The phrase I used was ""perceived as weak"" and that context was by bullies. You must be delighted you are not in that set."

0	So pretty! Great piping!
4	school is not that bad
7	And what about selling your precious mind creation to someone that doesn't deserve it?

9	The last message was particularly painful to read
26	so by that logic the right lost its mind about a year ago
0	[NAME]. You're just a fountain of inspiration and strength.
3	Still annoying.

1	You’re funny if you think 27 vs 1 is going to somehow end in a good deal for the UK.
26	>seek truth no matter how painful it is maybe you should take your own advice
20	[NAME] is timeless, so I think both can be true at once. We have been saved, are being saved, and will be saved.

5	"Presumably he was more excited about making her stay with some pedo jerkoff fantasy of ""Stockholm Syndrome"" .. oh she's staying cuz she looooooves me! "

20	I'm not close with my family so option 1.
18	Goth pale is lovely.
20	Yes, I’m aware. [NAME] loves LA and he isn’t worth 18 mil so he’d gladly take it.
2	Side deflects are stupid hard to pull off imo also because you might be used to 500ms lights or slower heavies for deflects his 600ms lights might throw you off
20	Over thinking things on both sides.

20	GDMNIT! Now I'm hungry!

23	I know it's easy for me to say because it wasn't me but money is money. We can always make more. Really sorry dude.
7	Nice try coppers.
3	Ignorance is unfortunately a part of mankind. We are still so Un-evolved
9	The west is so unfair :(
20	Can you imagine the [NAME] brothers getting pitched by a woman who believes in chemtrails
5	You seem pretty upset about this. It's not an email it is a formal filing. It doesn't surprise me you don't understand that though.
26	I thought chiropractors were bad! Look as these medical doctors who were pushing opiates on their patients by the thousands!
26	I wish I could forget. Stop reminding me :(
15	Thank you [NAME]. Best of luck. I'll always remember your goal to clinch MLS Cup 2017.
4	I’ve made snapchats like this for friends
2	You crush them up
21	I like that she thinks the water will save her.
3	Something's wrong. The top post on r/conspiracy isn't completely anti-conspiracy? Wow, feels weird. /s(?)
4	Oh definitely. When you work for the gov't you root for the party looking to expand it. Maybe that's how you'll get a raise right?
4	Cool. Glad I'm not the only one who found it weird.
9	Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.
1	I think [NAME] did such a classy exit! Hopefully people don’t give her too much hate. She comes from a good place.
6	I never will understand the reasoning behind puking in a toilet... Perfectly good bucket right there.
3	I'd imagine they're mostly fakes. You'd be uncomfortably warm in a real CG Parka in our climate.
20	Not really.
5	Now let's sit down, relax, and have a nice cool glass of turnip juice.
4	I believe we are playing them in June and November in the Euro qualifiers
0	You sound like you're going to be a great PA! Good luck in your new career.
0	[NAME] had a great idea about this problem actually

13	Hell yeah! Make sure you get your tickets in advance because we are getting very close to selling out!
15	I didn't realise this was happening! Thank you! It was hard to tell from OPs photo what the changes were
15	What a sweetheart.
21	Well Happy Birthday from another random stranger on the internet. I spent my birthday mostly alone too, hope your day wasn’t too bad. 💙
20	That’s not true at all. I play on xbox and you can’t Loot teammates you or any squad mates kill.
4	Yeah I could not even do that I could not move my leg to the side
10	If we can’t even score on the power play pulling the goalie made no sense
9	[NAME] gave me depression because had I been left unchecked I would have bested him in hand to hand combat by age 16
9	Women always seem to write that though, plus emotipns and emojis. When a man writes likr that it comes off odd ajd feminine in a bad way.
0	[NAME] is a gem and I love him but he should really be a DH somewhere
1	Same thing I thought haha
20	Welcome to New York.

10	nah. YOU will get it when you're about 20 years older.
4	Yeah so I got kicked from a group chat for gnoming people*
20	This show would suck without him. It would just be the same old [NAME] bullies someone bs it usually is
15	You dont know how much that boosted my self-esteem right now. Thank you stranger
2	She wasn't fucking running, no matter how hard you insist. You'd make a wonderful Qld cop with that mentality.
27	Looks weirdly fake Edit: turns out it’s real
5	No, don’t wait it out. Do everything you possibly can to lose it earlier in the meantime.
1	They’re words and they’re hilarious
23	That's ironic.
0	Makes us wonder what its going to be like for my children's generation..
17	If you bought it from Levi’s I think they do it for free at their flagship store

13	Yeah I know, it’s just wishful thinking but I would be ecstatic if it came out today
3	I have adhd whats so bad about it?
0	This is much better! Good mods [T]/
20	Those guys are on top 5 Levels.
3	..... That would seem like the ultimate way to get rejected and never spoken to again.
10	What? The non-vegan burger air particles have clearly infiltrated the once-pure cardboard. It is absolutely NOT vegan >:(

20	RemindMe! 1 day
7	Are you still sitting in the car right now?
20	Here is another extremely informative video about the Wii Shop Channel.
14	I am sorry but I can feel a panic attack. Holy moly I would die instantly If I were him
18	Loving this start boys
3	Mmmm that delicious karma :3
1	I think that had to do more with not wanting to hurt the old man lol
6	[NAME] has been injured for a while... No point in doing that comparison. Not sure if a troll or just new to football
4	The economy is heavily controlled and subsidized by the government. In any case, I was poking at the lack of nuance in US politics today
26	I'm nauseous
5	Be honest with her... or put her on a pedestal just high enough to see up her dress... ;)
20	Oh bb please tell me about possible sanctions
1	Nobody wants to fight the naked guy.
4	Yes that is so true why didn’t I think of that
10	Oh sh*t guys I got banned
9	That sex doesn't exist and we're all just pretending for his benefit...
4	You're free to believe all of that, but we're going to have to wait and see how it actually all plays out.
2	No, I don't mind all that much. I just hate being subjected to second hand carcinogens
11	And the woman dropped her underwear and begged him to fuck her. But in all his MGTOWness he refused.
20	Sweet sweet air con. Apparently it’s going to be a hot one today.
9	Your comment from exactly 40 days ago was, “Your mom.” I wouldn’t recommend you eat your words. 
18	[NAME] was the only one I actually liked, besides [NAME].
5	But we're just trying to diffuse the tension and teach them about peace!
7	If [NAME] hands the presidency to [NAME] do you really think the public will be more accepting of independent candidates?
7	"I'm curious about ""STERN? guy"" from the Phantom Menace review. I've never seen him in anything since."
20	Another pathetic PP.
10	It's not that bad. Not even the employees were cringe worthy. I'm glad that they were all enthused about having fun with the seniors.
2	all the more reason to not give a fuck about CFF
0	It's just a sexy hamburgler cosplay
20	[NAME]. And I’m not even trolling. I seriously love him.
17	I really enjoy my job but I get paid $62k I don't know if that's considered high paying but it's plenty for me.
20	I'm a cis woman and your wardrobe sounds like like my ideal fall wardrobe!
10	It's weird that actual socialists will say that politics has moved far to the right.
2	You get closure by blocking her on your phone and all social media. She dumped you. It's over.
4	They are very heavily scripted which is why it can be borderline unethical.
2	Welcome to racial integration, where your civility standards are racist and you better shut up or else.
1	She got me into it so not wrong lol
13	Except trophy hunters, although take away their gun and see how well they fare then.
20	You could try addressing the post you're replying to.
16	Not a different issue especially when the majority of the people affected by these deaths are lower income
20	Oh dayum. Didn't notice that the first time I looked at it. Yikes for OP.
18	>Gotta love the South No. No, you really don’t. 
20	i didn't figure 3 or 5 hours would break us up
21	I would go into the walk-in and curse like a sailor for a minute at full volume then freeze out the offender to the best of my ability.
0	Lucky you got a sane dad. Get ready for a world of crazy... just don't get sucked into her toxic world. Good luck.

15	I want the same drug OP is into thanks!

0	we need more [NAME] like [NAME] and [NAME]. So far those are the only 2 who I have seen stick to their principles.
26	I’m always reminded by my relatives on my birthday asking me if I have a girlfriend yet. Sorry bro ima yeet out of the social norm.
20	What real things pop out of existence because you stopped looking at them?
20	Ignored it and it will be forgotten 2-3 months from now.
17	Funny looking bats.
7	Honest question that's all.
4	Agreed. How do you feel about the rumors that he doesn't pick any girl as an endgame?
2	Fake lous!
20	Minimalist aesthetic stuff that doesn’t look goofy.
20	Because it's incredibly cringy.
20	And it’s being posted by a person who apparently has an MD, PhD, and MBA. One would hope they knew better
23	There was a fuel station near mine where they put the fuel in the wrong underground tanks. So you can at least unload it wrong.
24	Okay cool. Gonna drive home from the hospital.
20	They were bad times.
2	you are trying to use post-modern mumbo jumbo deconstruction of words. Go away, idiot.
4	Yep, you can go around crashing into things and run people over and completely get away with it. 
17	This made me chuckle. I hope it is raptors v warriors in the finals. That’s gonna be a fun series to watch.
11	I read it as him taking her virginity. Raping her...unless it was consensual and she WANTED to lose it.
20	I mean it’s definitely rushed but your clock is ticking and could be possibly on the verge of running out. I say go for it.
13	And a happy holiday to you.
23	I test ENFP and I relate to this thread so much.
20	>!I mean he did give himself a weird new arm...!<
4	The most siamese cat thing ive ever seen- weird, sexy, playful, smart, deadly. 
9	>putz Is he [NAME]? I would've not voted for him if I knew that.
3	I’ve just said that both biology and social norms play a part? How is that me saying that there are no biological differences?
20	Feb ‘06 [NAME] But your point stands
20	The caption is kinda stupid, but I like the photo.
10	And yet still just outside of the playoffs and not the worst team in the last 10 games.
20	The weight of all that water is enough to kill someone if they don’t drown.
20	Struck a nerve I see. Press X to doubt
20	Holy shit!!! 😮 That’s friggin beautiful
20	Until it gets to a point where you are a stalker.
0	That must smell so good. Oh i want some now.
4	Except people have been yelling about climate change for decades, it’s just that finally a prominent politician has made it their main point.
20	I wish this was me.. To have lots of friends.. *Sad dragon noises*
0	[NAME] has an amazing track record. I think some people forget how innovative and unpredictable the [NAME] era offense was.

4	Best part about this is that the cowboys will re-sign [NAME] and hopefully [NAME] too
10	Local Area Man Finally Finds Area Woman Willing To Let Him Sniff Her Hair

20	I bloody hate L3-37's name. it's literally L337. How much stupider can a droid name get.

20	US is of the top oil exporters in the world. 2003 wants it’s talking point back.

0	I've been in China for years. I love it. Great job, apartment and love my city. I've never had a single problem 
20	More fake news from CNN. I thought coming off the last fake news blowup they would at least bother to watch the video before writing their ridiculous story.
20	Interest rates seem crazy low. It doesn't seem worth it to lend anything except DAI.
3	It tasted strange to me.
17	Players like this makes me rage quit tbh.

1	This one has been around longer than you, buddy.
20	Surely the error is lexical. And I think the original comment is poor (non native) idiom use
0	Nice job censoring u/alexneverafter right there
20	While this makes me happy to know, it would probably be for the best if we didn't post these things where abusers can find out about them.
7	Are u gey
20	>provide a credible source. You first. For each claim.
20	>You're splitting hairs. Owning something vs having something on loan for however long the owner lets you have it is not splitting hairs.

8	okay but i need a strategy on how to deal with this
7	if HL in offensive stance dodges it, then doesn't raider also dodge it? Or is that fast recovery into moves that are not dodging again?

2	BUT ATHEISTS ARE DOING THE SAME THING AND ARE TREATED BETTER. No. You're just being a bigot.

4	Unite us. Unite the clans.

4	Absolutely, yes. I could not feel better right now, and I could not have felt worse yesterday.
18	[NAME] (swt) does not need your worship. If you do good deeds and humble yourself and seek forgiveness He might guide you again.

6	i am a little bit confused, who are these guys and why did you ask her if she is dead
20	If it didn't harm people who have no choice in the matter, I'd say let these people kill themselves.
25	Oh I thought it was something that was actually contemplated. My bad
6	That's what I can't understand either, what were they expecting by knocking on the door?
4	Feel free to use as many rhymes as you want, after all you have the final say of your word play.

4	Ok maybe I should watch Tangled

0	Absolutely insane documentary. I actually thought it was a parody at one point but it’s all real.
4	My point is that since they should both get the same sentence...it doesn't matter who is who. Push them both in...

3	Thank [NAME] though! Imagine someone like that with kids... yikes
20	You know what’s a real tragedy? I’m yet to find Soleil art with brand.
20	Maybe it depends on the state. In California, that means you’re a moderate [NAME].
1	lool ok I laughed pretty hard at this.
9	Considering how much they project and accuse how often they others of only hating X person because of their race, it makes sense.
20	Aye me, it's shite and the folk who follow it all think there cool, bore off
26	Could also be an overwhelming guilt in the heat of the moment. Probably hard to stay rational when you realize you've killed your own friend on accident.

0	This actually made me squeal like a little girl! Thats awesome!!!! Im so happy!
20	[NAME] having an adult life, yeah ist tiring. But not exactly new and not at all women specific imo.

2	The emojis in the background. Wtf lmao
15	We both will be having a read at these links, thank you! 
4	Yes that is so true why didn’t I think of that

10	i say no or in da club if they come to damce with me i walk away
27	Now I'm wondering if [NAME] drinks, and if he's ever been inebriated during one of his deals.
15	That’s good to know- thank you!
4	I like this
14	Worrying what other people think is what collectivists have brainwashed you to think and feel. You are just a coward making excuses for your cowardice.
17	I'm slightly ashamed to say I thought that was what the title implied too. Glad that's not the case
6	Either they don’t understand the meta context of it, or aren’t fans of such a meta ending.
20	You cannot open or keep it. You can send it RTS.
26	I'm so sad.
20	My point is that we should fight the whole system, not a single hospital that does the best they can. 
20	Just buy a load of old iPhone back covers in China.

20	Don’t be a class traitor
1	I was hoping they both were gonna hit the ground lol

2	If you had to think of a way to survive this how the hell would you. Damn
20	I can’t wait for this Narrative to stop. DLO has the best numbers just look.
10	Oh I know. [RELIGION] is the most severe form of brainwashing on the planet. There’s absolutely nothing like it. It blows my mind.
20	I kinda thought that's what you had meant. I'm a simple man.
17	That was fun.
20	You're not really pissing anyone off. Mostly we just pity you.
20	Both Islanders goaltenders support [NAME] and they are having career years, coincidence? I think not. 
15	We get it, you take Etizolam, congrats I guess..👏

1	A TECHNICAL Lmao.
20	These moments happen. Even if he was hella cold when he got home, you dont threaten a man. He may be stubborn enough to call your bluff 
20	But do you have a notoriously shady history a la Jax? (Hope not)
3	I want to call bs on this after smelling my boyfriend's. Have to leave the room whenever he lets one out...
4	I completely agree, I just think there is more of a chance of Clowney getting tagged than [NAME] getting tagged a second time.
26	Ned Stark: Dead Stark
20	This happens all too much. The game cannot keep up with so many actions especially if ur ping is bad
23	I would of gone to the doctor way before that
20	Prolonged eye contact.
4	You gotta find that fine line where you amass as much paper equity as possible while not sacrificing what’s really important in life.

2	I recommend this. I read the WN and it fucked up my English for months. English is my second language...
4	I’ve never heard him say it but I wouldn’t be surprised if he did. It’s believable enough
18	As much as I like [NAME] and want him to score so many (hes a speedy mofo) I think that this would be a good trade for sure
21	Please! She’s my #1 choice. The rare mix of super likeable and hypercompetent. Like [NAME] mixed with [NAME].

13	Too sore to make dinner tonight. Wong's Kitchen it is!

27	It could be bait and switch... Which would be a surprise
6	I thought [NAME] trained her after the boxing was over?
20	This only makes me want him more. Proves he is decisive and has self belief. Our team has been devoid of both.

3	Just thinking about all the stupid stuff I did as a kid makes me very afraid for my 5 year old.
2	I don’t care what anyone says. Party pizzas are the best frozen pizza you can get. Still mad about them being square now, though.

20	It's like [NAME] said, man. You look for the guy that benefits, and uh... You know, uh...
20	ball just bounced up a bit as [NAME] hit it, unlucky. Need to test [NAME] more, he's really not that great
20	that is an ar-15................
2	1200? I thought it was 12000! Ohhhhhhh. Dr. Now’s not going to be too happy with my weigh-in dis munt.
15	[NAME] sure saved that one from swirling down the toilet. Thank you [NAME].
15	Cool. Thanks for the tips!
12	That’s too bad, I didn’t know that.
15	thank you!
20	>Limes have autobreaking Ha! That's an amusing typo! You meant autobraking, I assume.
20	[NAME] back with the Goal Post love.
7	Hope your first day goes well, what type of work are you doing?
1	Exactly right! It would help if my fingers could type properly lol. Burr smh!
13	Omg [NAME] I can't stand Orange anymore after watching wentworth
15	Dear OP: Proper punctuation please/thank you.
20	After 3 sacks today, “Are you not entertained?” -[NAME] probably 
27	This is the most upbeat and pleasant I've ever seen someone whose been caught with multiple ounces of weed and ecstasy.
20	As I said, the justification needs to be found outside of a separate measure of support.
20	damn that kid can jump
15	Thanks. That's a handy resource. My question remains unanswered.
10	This should be the norm instead of the exception. Sadly the leaders in law enforcement are almost always more into politics than principles.
12	My t levels are normal. Doctor thinks its my low carb diet but I dont buy that
17	[NAME] playing for the heat always makes me laugh
3	All I want for Christmas is a broken home
10	I wouldn’t worry, most United fans have never even been to Manchester. 
13	sweet home alabama
7	Correct. The LTB judgements are enforced by going through small claims. Which makes for another hurdle for tenants trying to collect judgements.
20	I literally just finished watching the second episode of Daredevil. This pains me
4	Valid. That shit right there is valid as hell.
11	oh [NAME] this is horrible
1	This one is by [NAME]! Your suggestion was funny to me, and you've been blessed with your joke being DR Onion #20!
7	Are you implying that pundits rightly criticising shite refereeing is responsible for folk threatening [NAME]?
0	so proud of you!
3	"Holy shit. I remember sleeping on the back window ""ledge"" in my parents' car! I haven't thought about that in years."
1	This guy died on the inside lol
20	ROLL THE DICE
9	Omg I'm crying and shaking rn [NAME] would never say that
7	Looks like you don't have a story too.
20	The first guy had his balls covered, he knew.
4	I unironically approve of this message. It is time for the French Revolution to end.
0	The prevailing thought is he'll be too expensive to resign. I love him as a piece on the team but he's a deal sweetener.
20	Nobody is forced to use pronouns by law as he's claimed, it's a blatant lie he made up to further his agenda. 
0	Awesome, great to see people coming together for peer to peer cash!
7	I didn't realize being in my late 20s qualified me as a senior citizen, where do I get my AARP card?
13	Omg it’s like you’re taking the words from my mind.
7	Have you talked to him about it and made it clear he understands where you are coming from?
3	> shoddy hitboxes, imprecise movement Compared to what 3D game exactly? Have you not played Dark Souls?
7	What's the source? I love this.
7	Why should I get flayed? He's the one who sucks!
5	I grew up there!! Moved away 20 years ago but still my home. Hope you're having fun .
20	Little did you know 95% of these kids just don’t want to go to school
20	Human faces are remarkably elastic, aren’t they?
4	You are right. There's absolutely no group of liberals here that calls everyone right of [NAME] [NAME] every chance they get.
20	He is in [NAME] team. He bend a knee and give up the North because fall in love with her. As script said.
4	I think that making someone an approved submitter might get around that. Not 100% sure though.
9	That would be an unfamiliar feeling
10	You conveniently aren't speaking to my assertion.
8	I wish I could get the entire interview but it's from a SiriusXM Radio Show
7	Were these the platforms they ran on.
20	I seen a video, must have been one of the students where they've completely surrounded the [NAME]. 
20	Brother, we've been separated.
13	Happy cake day to him
8	I really wish this wonderful person would run for president! <3
20	I don't remember accurately but something in the lines of >and slightly leaning back so as to not be able to reach the remote
20	Wait a second what? The asshat found the story? Can someone teach me how to use the way back machine so i can read this?
13	Almost in tears watching him celebrate, true captain ❤️
3	Reading that made my stomach feel how it does when I get the wind knocked out of me.
23	She looks like that in every photo
1	she does look like a hooker though lol
20	okay but i need a strategy on how to deal with this
20	Ugh [NAME] is like when your ex-girlfriend suddenly gets really hot. I can't even look at him.
3	> I dont understand why team record matters so much. The entire purpose of playing is to win games.
0	Did you guys personally pay someone for the banner? Because that's incredible.
18	I love it
1	Your comment reminds me of that one satirical GTA V radio ad where the advertiser tries to encourage people to beat their kids. It's kinda funny.
7	Do you think each worker looks after only one child?
4	I actually find it easier to place spawn beacons in stupid spots like this than a nice flat empty piece of ground.
0	Take a upvote I'm glad I made your experience great
20	But if we go to the FCS right now, and never play y'all at the cotton bowl again, we keep the hat.
9	already exposed when h2k went 2-16. Sure they didn't have the best players, but going 2-16 means the coaching staff should also shoulder the blame.
5	Dude, take back your life and dignity. GTFO!!!
0	There kinda funny
20	Then stop arresting them for shooting at thieves
4	Some people just need a hug
13	Wowowowow!!!! I’ve been campaigning for [NAME] too!
20	It’s not really a surprise that sick people consume more healthcare resources than people who aren’t sick, is it?
6	A successful centralized ratings company?
3	honestly i don’t think logan paul meant anything except to sound woke so he could get attention
20	We’re some spoiled [NAME].
20	I think it has more to do with them deriving a sense of identity from work. Remove the work and what remains?
0	They then went to a piano concert together. This conflict is amazing in it's twists and turns.
20	The secret is you have to ice them for ten minutes.
14	Any one of us could be a journalist, and that level of journalism feeding the masses is mildly scary.
2	What are you apologizing for? Vent bro, that’s why we are here
10	Didn't expect him to land back in the championship, although mears was much more unlikely
20	Never surrender mate
10	I thought it may be the industry, but based on other people’s answers here, I’m not so sure :/ 
10	Definitely not Mom’s favorite.
4	good lookin out bro
20	From super smash bros melee?
15	plz pm the telegram group thanks
6	We had 2 1000 yrd receivers, why would we add a 3rd?
20	I mean it certainly is a ritual so to speak.
15	We will welcome you with open arms <3
2	Wow that is one part disgusting and another part a huge waste of time for expecting an entertaining payoff. Warning, this video also includes spoilers for the latest Avengers.
15	Kudos to OP for not falling for the bait.
20	We absolutely can't leave the first three rounds without an offensive tackle. Preferably Round 1 or 2
20	Probably an old dude.
13	New flavour! I love it!
7	Except that he's doing it because there's an election quickly approaching.
20	Didn't he say [NAME] should cave and give [NAME] his wall money?
23	He got his drawers blowed off
20	They were saying the other guy who revelead this was lying! I knew it was true. Mods are gonna delete this post dude they are censoring.
20	He's rooting for the losing team and is pissed.
18	I love you
23	HUGE difference! SO important! Amen sister.
9	I hope you can get some relief soon, I can’t imagine how awful that must feel 
20	He wasn't being a jerk he was playing .they are friends you can tell by the way they interacted
20	Damn Blake is on fire today
9	You win the poverty Olympics.
20	This is what I assumed, but I haven't seen any confirmation of this anywhere.
20	His plan would have worked if [NAME] was not teleported by the writters for that dramatic (And nonsensical) part of the episode.
19	The “figuring it out” part seems really hard
0	I'll show some love for diazepam! Congratulations on the re up and let me Know if they are
21	I hope your relationships are no longer abusive either physically or emotionally.
1	you’re too lazy to google
20	Or he could just not share your beliefs? I mean, you don’t think his ethnicity should dictate his political views, do you?
11	But that makes even less sense. The government is having a hard time collecting taxes, therefore people are poor? 
4	Gl hf team we can do this! :[NAME]: Whole team leaves
0	My favorite calm BGs are [NAME] and [NAME] :)
20	He was playing with absolute garbage teammates, and the one year he was on a decent team he had 44 points in 48 games. 
2	[NAME] just wants to post pics of her facetuned of herself for attention while acting morally superior to those other girls. fuck off
23	Sounds like you know the answer, and at first she will resent you. But hopefully over time will realize what your doing. 
7	I just realized people in apartments are essentially screwed, that is too bad man, hopefully you'll get that going soon! It's worth it!
9	When you're accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression.
14	I don't know how accurate that is, pure nicotine is a lot different to nicotine in tobacco so I doubt vaping is that addictive
20	I wouldn't want to take any of his medals away but lets also not act like he was instrumental in either.
20	This is about as unacceptable as the subject can get.
13	no its amazing.
15	Super helpful. Thanks!
18	Let's get petty! Love it
8	Maybe one day but I am very cultured*
20	I see this as a guy making fun of a small sect of women, not a bitter jab at all as a whole
11	Seriously? That’s so frustrating. It was [NAME] time to go, some of these “fans” are disgusting.
4	Okay, you accidentally injured someone. Good luck in court buddy
10	No. Not the I. :(
2	She should be FIRED
16	Because Im going to feel sorry for the death of someone who assaulted me. Sure thing buddy.
4	Saw a video on Instagram from my friend that lives in Longmont. The snow looks so pretty. Do want.
15	Good to know the obsessive thinking is because of them... I’ve felt like it was just me ha. Thank you 🙏
1	I for one am with you on this train. I loved [NAME] man but this sub is losing its damn mind lol
20	Dan cool and rich
20	The twist is that is that it was all a [NAME] fever dream the whole time.
0	[NAME] has so many people shook.
20	....it’s just raining on my face
0	One time, she punched me in the face. It was AWESOME.
20	League wants an LA team to finally work so bad
20	Humm, just a few days after I unsubbed. You aren't luring me back again though r/Murderedbywords !
10	I did something along those lines almost 2 years ago and got to 67 upvotes before I got banned
21	imagine if this was [NAME] people would lose their shit
23	it's the result of a structural problem inherent in all forms of vanguardism, though. it's not the result of MLs being fascists or not leftists
7	>but part of the whole inequality picture is women receiving lower pay for the same jobs. Honestly? Doesn't happen.
20	It most definitely is! You’ve gotta pick some up!!
10	The master will not be pleased.
20	Man that was a long of run on sentences but whatever.
15	Ah, well thank you. On an unrelated note, does “Benchys” mean boobs?
23	She was sorry too, after I found out and ripped her a new one. LOL
20	Came here to say exactly this. It's almost the same scene, as if he tried to recreate it
10	Probably. The fact his reaction to you being injured was to go off and have sex with a stranger is not a healthy sign.
9	Came here looking for the knowitall that explains the difference. Disapointed in reddit today.
20	I wasn’t talking about them buddy...
26	RIP manning lol
23	Oh. You’re one of.... ^*those.*
21	Looks expensive. Hope you enjoyed the game!
20	I told [NAME] not to shoot [NAME] cause I didn’t think [NAME]’ dumbass would turn his back right in front of her.
20	r/LazyMan. 1080p 60fps.
20	I said none of those things. My awareness of a slang term and its means is just that. Understanding language.
20	It will only get worse over time. Do what I didn’t. Run.
20	I'd say no, mostly because you don't plan to stay long-term.
5	There's a Houston Jobs subreddit that may be of some help!
24	This is a serious question. Are you glad they told you?
20	That dog did not want saved at all.
7	A bag of pita chips is really $8?
8	Get him back -- as in figure out what went wrong and see what you can do
4	Bad sarcasm in response to a bad joke seems about right to be fair.
20	you can’t duel yourself you walnut
3	If that’s the case then these shows really are all about messing up people’s health...
7	Show me that hog daddy
20	Its hard to look at. Its just gross.
20	> for solo players Play. Mercenary. Playlist. :)
20	[NAME] ONLY WANTS STUPID VERONICAS AND STACIES AND NOT US, GAYS RISE UP
20	Mmmm squeeze dat cheek
20	Interesting my bodies blurry but I wanna dtW that
26	i ended up crying and breaking down once i got to my friends house, i'm so sorry that happened to you as well :~( 
17	I'm so glad [NAME] finally got her visa, she's going to do awesome living in the USA!!!!
8	Thank you .. I wish I was religious.. I admire religion... My mind just doesn't want to believe..
20	I'd watch out for the brother. He seems like the type of guy to try to murder you years from now.
2	Don’t tell me what to do.
20	It's not really controversial any year, but he's commentating a game with [NAME] in it. He has the counterpoint right in front of him.
4	At this point all you can do is put full faith in the man. Let him get creative
0	Yeah, I was thinking they would be super cute with black heels and a snug black crop top.
16	I tell them my wife died in a car accident 10 years ago and I couldn’t fall in love again. I’ve never been married.
17	I think everyone would enjoy it more if you did
1	asking for a source is good lol
18	I would love both of them
1	Don't, it's shit compared to the original. It's rather WATERed down :P Jokes aside it isn't as good.
26	sad that the Euphoric tipbot is no more
6	Does she hate the men in her family too? O.O
18	Gotta love jetpacking.
7	Wait a minute, the rich own ranches.... You're one of them!
3	Just shut up dude
20	Don’t link the technical definition of terms if you don’t want people to apply it. Enjoy your New Year.
20	Yes. Many wedding parties don't know what to do with the ring bear after the vows, so there are many up for adoption.
20	You'd think, but people are given a lot of leeway. Hell, in the South, public schools are allowed to spank children.
0	[NAME]. growing some ladyburn1974 as part of my first grow. thank you!
2	Holy fuck [NAME]!
1	I guess some people just hate fun, lol
20	Same.. that was brutal
4	Dude you’re right but just because we draft someone in the 1st round doesn’t guarantee a starting caliber QB.
1	Lmao you fart bigger to cover up the first one
1	I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Either way. Lol
3	Holy shit that’s nothing
15	Eh, that can happen anywhere. It isn't exclusive to Dallas where that stuff happens. Good luck tho.
5	His whole point is that he doesn't have to give a damn about others or how they feel.
20	The people I went to school with work the checkouts at my local one, no escape.
5	Happy caketh day
8	I really need to get more sleep.
20	I just watched this episode the other day. I was MORTIFIED. I like seasoned chicken, but not that kinda season no
20	Literally a post on reddit by a woman being creepily hit on by a neighbor, with his wife's permission. Today.
10	That's not what follows from that at all.
20	Did he use his full title when he introduced himself. Cause that would be sweet
6	I'm struggling to find what you're referring to here, could you maybe add something that points to it?
11	Do your worst. The tag just describes your views. Could have been much more vicious.
23	Ha, that would be a novel experience. He'd better let me deal with it.
5	That's how you're supposed to serve a pretzel, so it doesn't go soggy whilst lying flat on a plate. 
20	Sweaty little incel virgin
0	Um excuse me the static reflectives are the best v2s period.
20	10 mg Trintellix and 1.5 mg Vraylar
0	I was actually coming here to add a comment about her! She’s so cute and talented!
20	Asides from the max number of choices each share, probably being shamed on the internet
4	Baby you was right
5	Had she gone into the left shoulder before braking she may have had a chance.
1	Well shit, if all you gorgeous people haven’t settled down yet, there’s no hope for me
18	I like it!
20	If you bought it from Levi’s I think they do it for free at their flagship store
7	The song must be thrilling
0	Sounds epic man
18	I just discovered her today and I love her music
3	I feel like it took for fucking ever actually. Still too fast, but anything would be
0	I don't want PR to vote because they'll vote blue. I want them to vote because they deserve the right to have representation.
15	She has started therapy with an addiction specialist. That is a hopeful sign IMO. Wish she had started a while ago.
20	She looks like a crackhead.
0	"If [NAME] had served all fast food buffet to a football team Reddit would be circlejerking ""So down to earth and amazing!!1"""
11	Thank you! I will take that warning under consideration. History is brutal but there's detail and unnecessary detail.
27	Omg lmfao!!
20	I mean, I know you are being sarcastic, but your words are too accurate for something a supporter would actually say 
2	Outraged suburban white moms ranting about stupid things that don’t matter and making ridiculous comparisons are peak humor
10	"[NAME], I thought we warned you about trying to collect ""data"" from this place."
15	Oh sorry I gotcha
0	Great. I guess they learned from previous shutdowns.
23	I never really thought of myself as an ex-[RELIGION] until recently, so many no.
2	The bourgeoisie elected courts were going to backtrack on all [NAME] economic reforms. Fuck those guys.
17	Ignorance is bliss
20	[NAME] likes a Pacific plan, too.
18	Nope, midwest. I'd bet there are a bunch of shops with the same stuff though. P.S. I love your name!
5	Good luck!
20	It more means nuxia needs help.
13	Oh you're the life of the party.
20	[NAME] sucks. Rally killee
2	It won't make them worse off. GDP is simply irrelevant. Rent and job conditions are what matters.
0	[NAME] consistently being the guy with most energy. We need him on the floor more.
2	I considered becoming a teacher, but then I considered the little bastards would eat me alive.
1	The line the reviews were not positive made me laugh for some reason.
15	Thanks so much for taking the initiative to do this! Not all heroes wear capes :)
20	There are dozens of us.
13	You should check out my comment at the bottom of this thread of why I somewhat support antifa. This comic is obviously fearmongering conservatives.
7	It goes a long way to explaining American mental health issues. Have you ever bothered to read anything?
25	Let's keep making that trade with different teams until we have all 32 picks in the 6th round one year Sorry, I'll go back to my NHL19
2	Holy crap, what happened to that guy?
18	OMG she reminds me of Ginger from Ginger Snaps! I'm in love!
5	Obviously the super sisters will save her.
9	Yo but that RivaL lineup tho! That's gonna be so sick
10	Those are hoteps. They're delusional idiots; no one takes them seriously.
4	Ouch. Rough year for the jags. Where upstate are you?
3	It's interesting that you don't address anything but just come to troll
17	Nae bother, Happy to bring musical joy in to any household.....
20	Eh, not in Europe, it ain't.
0	[NAME]² ~~good play btw~~
20	My knees, I had to quit running because they got so bad. Even hiking starts hurting after awhile, especially on long downhills Also glasses and deep voices
1	That's the funniest mental image I've had in a very long time!
4	I guess the caveat is that is a world championship offyear where not all players are available due to playoffs
23	Seems kind of literal
15	Many people from 2004 played Fortnite too. You know, because it's a good game and not everyone likes to hate on things arbitrarily.
20	I mean, if it’s rotten food, especially fruit, mixed with various meats and maybe some seafood- you can get a pretty mean stench going. 
20	Obvious troll is obvious.
1	My favorite is this gem where [NAME] told [NAME] to stop whining and there is no election rigging..two weeks before the election
7	to 6:30. Does that look fake to you?
6	Doesn't help that it's not actually cheese. Looks like a pretty standard Vegan mac+whatever you wanna call it
0	My stylist is a fit, handsome guy with big, sexy hands. Can't say I don't like it when he tousles my hair.
0	All without a red circle, color me impressed.. 
4	I have a college-level understanding of biology, as it is my degree of choice. Those 8th-graders are completely right. 
2	Even if it’s available 24/7 on your new website 99% of it is ugly so people still won’t buy it.
17	Griefing your oponents is amazing fun in a pvp game. *Cheating* to grief is the problem being addressed here.
20	This means bisexual
20	[NAME] and [NAME] did alright together. They were both disappointed with the outcome (initially at least) but Under Pressure was a huge hit.
13	It’s amazing.
20	It’s probably down to low player base.
20	Where did I state I wanted to keep Syria going? Is making things up just a usual part of your arguements?
0	I love your username
4	He’d definitely get dropped at some point and then all hell will break loose
27	Oh baby a triple!
4	Oh you'd prefer if I used this pic instead? I understand.
20	Yep, she's completely isolated. Part of the abuse.
2	WHO'S EVEN ON THE ROSTER AGAIN? FUCK, [NAME]? [NAME]?
18	I actually currently have a girlfriend and I love her. It's just that those past situations gave me trust issues for life I guess.
0	Great trade for us but we're losing some forward depth in [NAME]. Tbh though I would be willing to take the risk.
4	You need to recheck your science. A simple Google search will yield research articles showing a biological and genetic basis for being LGBT. Happy reading!
9	I want to see that too, but we all know it's not going to happen.
3	[NAME] just commented on my comment with links to the pamphlet! ‘Tis real!
20	AT doing some work!
10	I was worried about that too honestly
10	True, but it all started under [NAME] and will get even worse if Labour manages to get into government. 
17	Nice try with your 1/3 pan and t rex arms there buckaroo /s
20	You may have been watching a tad too hard bro lol No judgment here
20	American conservatism has been stolen by the neo Nazi, bigoted crowd. [NAME], [NAME], et al would vilify these hacks.
27	With those pieces I’d be surprised 😒
10	Seems like an odd hypothetical question to ask.
5	I'm sorry I watched that
3	I honestly do not know. Chastise them for their hardness of heart and presumptiveness I suppose. I guess that is what [NAME] would do.
20	It sounds like you project a lot of anger...maybe letting things go, relaxing and slowing down is your solution.
0	so nice i had to put her twice
20	Just stop.
6	Maybe it was. I don't really understand what the point you're trying to make here is.
12	Understand their point of view, 13 IS too young. Imagine how they felt when they found out their innocent child was watching adult videos.
3	2 warm days and we all lose our minds? :)
20	Bah gawd that drop step fake pass turnaround jumper is [NAME] move! They really love each other!
4	Sure it's okay. Very sorry for your loss. Your dad's posts kept me coming back here when I was just a lurker. Much appreciation.
0	Great write up, you’ve sold me on Munchak being a good hire.
20	[NAME] is a murderer,a psychopath and he wants just to kill him
20	Yeah maybe they'll finally get a shred of evidence in another two years haha
18	WE LIKE SPORTZ AND WE DON’T CARE WHO KNOWS
10	McRibs are back on the menu but not in the Washington DC metro area.
9	Not possible to change da truth
2	£10 for copy pasting a wall of text from /r/gamerghazi? Why would I want to do that.
0	You couldn't even figure those out? Wow. Speechless.
4	I feel ya man. Stayed up to prestige and now I can’t sleep anyways.
4	Teachers today complain, but zero tolerance does prevent the whole bull-whip/beat-to-death scenarios.
3	Solid. Giving the other customer sauces for free was especially petty, I like.
20	Nice story. Which I guess is why it's #3 in the sub right now :)
20	Trust me no one getting caught but this dumb MF
11	It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about
21	I did. In a selfless sacrifice that I hope brings ample awards.
4	He looks like [NAME] soooo... accurate.
20	Upvote for buttfuckme.
20	This just in: we’re all FAKES because of [NAME]
20	I'm not sure you know what a [NAME] is
18	I love Ashtray
4	You may be onto something. Strange that I agree with this now.
0	No no this sub has so much to offer. So many great pictures to see. You have a great place here.
20	Ahhhhh you should start screaming and flailing. What a piss poor argument. Now I believe in invisible dragons.
15	Thanks [NAME]. We hardly knew ye
0	Excellent jobs, young men!
3	This is the most adorable thing I've seen in a long time. I hope the intro went well.
0	You look awesome in this picture
1	I can honestly say I didn't know a single guy in highschool that put on makeup lol
15	Thanks! I’ll be sure to do that!
2	QB Coach too? Shit..
20	I already know what they're dealing with, i just cant help without hurting them emotionally or lying to them
9	This shirt IS a problem. Get rid of it.
15	Thanks. Timeless and eternal right?
20	I believe you. Have you compared them to any other designs of headphones in the same price range though?
3	You people really overestimate how much welfare actually covers. You act like one child is making six figures and giving their entire family an MTV Cribs lifestyle.
20	Not all idiots with guns put others in danger. Many just have bad sense with guns. An even smaller percent actually causes damage to people.
27	I'm not saying to hate them, I'm wondering why this sub just started worshiping them.
4	Well that’s just like, your opinion, man
10	Not [NAME]! He had 0.9% kick to selfs so he'll probably keep bunging them in from the goal square and not getting any stats.
14	I'm working on it. But there is always the fear lurking around....
27	Surprised he didn’t get hit with a random drug test
13	I’m desperate for it. I once got to lie in bed with a girl friend a couple times. That was cool. But we barely touched.
4	I REALLY should get my breaks checked.
20	But what if he feels like his position is appealing to those the [NAME] have left behind?
3	"Have her listen to the ""year of poligamy"" podcast. You realize that polygamy was more f'd up than you could ever imagine. "
4	Yeah. Unless you live in a desert, ditch the scarcity mindset. It can keep you in relationships that aren't any good.
20	People need to relax. [NAME] as the 5th starter is fine. Look at his road splits. Limit his starts at home.
4	Except of course that's not what I said. Autists like you like to live in a fantasy life.
20	Myers Briggs test is like the star sign for a different kind of nerd
10	American democracy is weak but it's not dead. If the intention of your comment was to discourage people from voting then you are the problem.
10	You're not [NAME] about your joke, good pun there mate

20	Hi [NAME]? You mean like what we say when the night manager comes into work?

22	We may destroy the rest of the world in the process.
0	I spent a week in Ottawa one night. Amazing architecture but awful, filthy, drug infested city. Terrible ppl and a dirty trash hole.
20	Interestingly enough I think it just needs to be the heavy creamer, my wife has some sensitivities to some dairy but not all forms of it. 
20	Seeing the past doesn't mean being in the past

0	Wow. I dig that.

11	I just saw a snot nosed brat eat a croissant on the subway and got crumbs all over and the snobby rude mom left like nothing happened .
23	Yeah -- a woman who expects a guy to never even think about other women for the rest of his life is a special kind of delusional.
18	I love it! Guy in front can steer, can't propel. Guy in back can propel, but can't steer.
20	[NAME] is a vile excuse for a human being and a stereotypical, alt-right, [NAME] supporter.

4	Money, specifically other people’s money in large quantities.

2	I'm going to blow your fucking mind. I dip my Hawaiian pizza in ranch. Booooooooom.

23	>testing teenagers for four mystery roles Oh good lord. This is going to be even worse.

17	You too. Glad to hear your respectful voice again
7	Does this have any association with KPW?

20	I may have got lung cancer and hiv but at least I was around when [NAME] was haha baby-boomer win!
20	Why is it dumb? It's not like once people get married they believe in a society that looks down on premarital sex. Maybe you missed my point.
9	yeah i guess being a sexually unsuccessful giant dweeb is being red pilled
17	The card game in Episode 2 is probably the happiest [NAME] has been in a while.

12	For real. After I saw that, I just stopped reading. My eyes spun right out of my head. 
20	They wont touch a hero if they tweaked it in last 6-12 months. Like [NAME], they fucked/nerfed her and thats it.

18	I like [NAME] suit less the more I see it in action.

0	Three year olds learn it's wrong to draw on the walls with crayon. I think you look stupid in this thread.

6	Alright thanks, I was so confused for a sec. Thought [NAME] pointed to an uneven bump on the ground 
3	Meh, it just keeps players from diving in taking stupid damage. (At least it should.)
3	I watched that worm fish sauce thing. So gross, disgusting, bleh, NO,NO, and HELL NO!!
23	I should have said without nuts in hindsight, but this woman was ready to kill. Gotta love hospitality sometimes.
26	I'm so sorry
18	You see, when a router and a hard drive love each other very much...
1	People like standing in line drunk for extended periods of time, apparently. I don't know how else you could enjoy that experience except lots of booze. 
23	Ah from what I understood you could barely read the biggest line on the chart. I thought this was a general statement.
3	I don't know what she is talking about. Therefore i will say that she is DEFINITELY WRONG AND SHOULD SHUT UP! /s
20	And it’s only 100 degrees with 90% humidity.
20	Poor lady, she was the mother of a friend of my wife, and she went to school with my father in law :(
3	I heard [NAME] makes someone his bitch on a usual basis. Anyone remember how often?
4	ok now you are being adorable on purpose i see what youre doing
10	Nothing wrong with pasta or bread. Stop buying bleached flour products and get whole grain.
0	Love it or hate it. That kid is a hero
10	[NAME] is already gone and he knows it. No way he’s re-elected.
6	Honestly I’m confused in 10 different ways here
7	“Oh hey, I think a second ago [NAME] just put a move on [NAME]! Oh boy I wonder how that was.”
7	What’s she interested in? Has she taken any interest in games that you play?
21	Stranger things have happened, but still, good luck.
20	Don’t quote me on there being fish in there, it just looked like a nice picture.
17	Aww now I can’t listen to falling down
20	Please don’t. Please talk to someone
17	I'm so happy that this worked for you! Go forth, and have unashamed sex in my honour.
14	Looks deliriously boring.
14	When you’re having a dream and the psycho is coming for you but you can’t move...
21	I hope you aren’t saying that there is no co-relation between imperialism/colonialism and standards of living in the West, in this case Britain.
0	You're so special and quirky :D
3	I know, and the unfortunate thing is many of my friends in this area have had somewhat similar experiences with dudes who just are just total creeps. 
20	((((((Make me))))))
20	I'm not going full vegetarian but I am trying to cut down on eating meat a bit.
1	I watched that one, her butt is real lol
26	Rip the guy from psych
26	Well this all started Wednesday. But I’ve been unhappy with my life for weeks now
17	He happily accepts the hugs. He hugs me now and again. He also has no problem accepting hugs from his mum.
7	Two different writers have two differing opinions??? I'm shocked, just absolutely shocked, I tell you!
6	Wait, did this really happen? I'd like to see that video so I can cringe some more plz.
20	I don't think cryptocurrency is ready for such using. Although in Asian countries like Singapore or Hong Kong it's quite acceptable I guess.
5	Just know that you are the man. Go Isles. Go Flames.
10	There have been multiple threads about this, they can't afford to move up. It's not financially feasible.
6	It was never implied as such. You simply mistakenly interpreted it that way.
20	-no scary creatures trying to kill you- Ha! You haven't heard of Rhode Islanders yet! /s
15	I'm sorry to hear that things went down like that. Good luck with everything.
10	What can you expect from guys who think everything based on sex and romance is solely based on a person’s looks and not at all their personality?
21	Good luck!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
11	It's so ugly, nice.
3	Mine does this too but reaches out ever so gently and caresses my face. Like thanks bud, but no thanks.
20	Don't worry, neither have I
20	I wqs right on [NAME] CMC So so so wrong about [NAME]
18	Comic sans to seal the deal. Love it.
7	Either you meant family doc or there's an interesting story here you're not sharing. I'm hoping for the latter.
18	Terribly sad story. I loved it.
21	Ladies go out and find a dorky nice and wholesome guy, there may not be many of us but we’re out there
20	[NAME] got bank...he's paying people to count his cash. He's doing fine
18	I love cowboy.
20	Oh [NAME], someone did it already, and it was 3 DAYS AGO O.O
4	I know right, im pre everything but sometimes i paint my nails and people will tell me how much they look like a womands hands.

17	if they just let girls enter like these cats :)
20	Yay! Smug buddies!
0	Such a great movie that kinda gets overlooked.
20	Da Colts!!! Go frank go!!!
27	Weird. He's like the one capitalist in this sub that I feel I've had substantive conversations with.
2	[NAME] is not a smart man. Giving a fraud a fucking card. Like wtf
15	damn. Thanks!
22	I look cuter in red P’s.
4	Yup, not enough money
20	Its more about Russia not making such overtly antagonistic statements about Iran.
0	Super helpful. Thanks!
2	me as fuck
0	WOOO!!! You go boy!!! Good job!! That’s a huge milestone checked off and SURVIVED! Yay!!!
20	Maybe. Or maybe its going to make the US stay. Some peoole are saying it was done to keep the US from leaving syria.
21	as someone who dealt with a burn out/mental break down 4 years ago, /s/ this post makes me feel very optimistic about the future /s/
10	It's just a human problem. I lose track of how many stories a month come out about some teacher getting caught sexually abusing 1-3 of her students.
17	And he was like “umm you woke me up for this, [NAME]?!” Lmao. That made me laugh.
4	I totally agree and I think this was suggested before as well
3	 It an argument. Don’t really have time for jack-assery. Lot of people want attention from me tonight, not just you. 
26	That is utterly horrifying. I'm so sorry that your kindergarten teacher was such a heartless old bat.
23	Oh I didn't even know there was a web novel
20	Come on, at least give the man some eyebrows
6	You were in a movie once!
15	Considering I’m majoring in politics, that’s the plan!!! Thank you! 
20	Baths, especially after the gym. Fresh flowers in the apt. Emotions are pretty cool too.
20	She does it again in last nights episode, it’s so shady!!
20	"I mean, one has to do the research. Buying a lemon doesn't mean that having a car is ""worthless""."
18	Lovely act of kindness🤗
20	I never heard much detailed discussion at church, mostly general references to them.
20	Super fucking lucky
18	I like that idea.
26	His wrists are too small ☹️
20	You'll find a few down South, too. No surprise.
15	Thank you!!! I'll do this now!!!
20	This is not Texas exclusive slang. I've lived in the Midwest and the east coast, everyone uses this slang...
25	Oh my lord I am so sorry. That is just despicable. Internet hugs.
20	The views that are pro-apartheid and pro-ethnic cleansing are illegitimate, whether or not they are “[RELIGION] views” doesn’t matter.
20	Just out of curiosity, what happened with the big dog?
20	His! Watch out! That cars coming straight for you! Omg guys she’s arguing with ferrah, she can’t hear us help!
3	Looks deliriously boring.
2	The FDA has plenty to criticize. But like here, it's usually criticized horribly off base. It needs to grow some balls and actually enforce things. 
15	Nice man!! Wish you guys the best. Here I am FA again after a 2 1/2 year relationship ended lol so enjoy it while it lasts
17	I would not be surprised seeing as both picked up [NAME] and the other [NAME].
20	No? This is literally saying that a wall would be useless, unless you also wanna build 40-50 feet beneath the ground.
23	Yeah it looks like it
26	Bro, highmountain looking sick
4	If you wanna know how rappers rape ask [NAME]
0	I mean, I’m an occasional monarchist myself. That doesn’t mean I’m under some delusion that it’s a fix all.
20	N00b account tosses insults - how surprising.
20	Idk if I’m wrong but I think they gave her some piercings on her ear which are cool too
6	Are you [NAME]?
2	What in the actual fuck....
4	Your desperate attempts to pretend that this is nothing are...really weird, to be totally honest.
4	That’s reasonable
0	Thanks [NAME] for moderating, I appreciate the hard work you guys do!
20	Mod like that should get doxxed honestly.
10	No but it would be weird if you masturbated to it like I did
0	It's such a relieving feeling to know you're finally gone. You never have to go back. You are so strong you got this!!
3	How mature of you. Resorting to name-calling is delightfully childish. I expected nothing less.
18	I mean I like the park and I was surprised by that poll too
20	That's exactly what I thought too!!!!
20	We do have Uber. I use it the odd time. The main difference is that here it's taxis only due to regulations.
20	Very excited for what could come from his presidency, very much not excited for the primaries.
20	oof okay, thanks for the info. Hopefully he fares better with our line/TE's
20	I'm glad they called it. Basketball is so dumb in that it's one of the few sports you're rewarding for committing a penalty.
25	Season x? Sorry bitch but no.
20	They dont mind a second trump term if [NAME] 2020 looks likely
15	Thank you kind internet stranger for listening to me. I feel a little less alone for the moment.
8	Was really hoping he’d drive off with it (sigh)
4	Understandable in this day and age of gaming.
27	I would be surprised if she's doesn't have at least 1 kid
4	Yes, but [NAME] is right when he warns about the US involvement in Venezuela.
25	I'm sorry [NAME]. I won't do it again.
3	Yes, clearly u/backwoodmenace was repeating misinformation intentionally.
7	But who is filming him?
3	Yheaaa I always gave me till 35 to decide if I want a kid or not. [NAME] kicked in sooner than expected.
0	Video games are great, but sometimes it’s nice to unplug and play a game of Jenga with your cat
20	because you are in danger of appropriating methhead culture.
14	I thought about it before. But I'm afraid I might get in trouble.
8	I wish to die with my will and spirit intact!
20	we're all in the same struggle except for those few traitors that dared to go out and actually get into a relationship
20	"As a song from my favorite anime of all time goes: ""Make the impossible possible"""
20	I may be wrong but I think cows are stronger than horses, or at least made to be 
14	that day humanity received a grim reminder
0	Coq was great man...
9	I bid my condolences to any player who did not experience release day action. “*Glorious battles, tooth and nail* *Noobs arrived, our matches grew stale*”
20	I really try to not use that terminology as it is inconsistent and was made up by people who know little to nothing about firearms.
4	It's less about what actually happened. What's done is done. I just want her to know why sexual exclusivity was so important to me
4	"""Thanks for showing me your red flags within the first 10 seconds of interaction."""
15	Thank you. I’m sorry that happened to you.
21	You also have the option of making it quite unique. Would be a delight to see if you got it!
10	Men don’t have it worse but at least society cares about women.
4	I'll be honest - I just want new stories. Not prequels. Doing things in the past are just too limiting with storytelling.
20	That has to be an understatement, I know several myself
4	I've been really into reading nonfiction lately and ancient religious history sounds fascinating! Do you have any books you recommend?
7	I'm not sure anyone has asked, and feel free to not answer. But is your feeling that the team definitely favors [NAME] right now? 
4	"I honestly thought that they could have chosen ""bigger"" words than those, [NAME] clearly knew what they meant!"
13	Every time I see MCC news I get briefly excited for PC news. I really need to stop :(
20	How the hell
20	I also always wear a condom with straight guys. Who knows where they’ve been...
20	Communism naturally results in dictatorship. When you centralize power, you invite the power-hungry. Every morally-motivated communist seems to think they're immune to the bullets of power-hungry totalitarians. 
20	The latter is correct.
1	Especially the jellies, they come up so fast!
26	[NAME] dude I’m sorry. That’s their problem now. Bump some [NAME] and keep moving forward.
2	Oh I just hate her character. Personally her kit is super fun. But I don't like her character at all
20	I literally have more friends on HOTS than WOW. Wow is deader than hots.
3	This is not a legal issue. Take it up with your school if you don't agree with it.
4	I know what I said son
20	They’ve always loved her. i read this in the space of five episodes.
27	I'm surprised she could operate a suitcase.
13	"To be fair, ""Junior"" was released 25 years ago."
13	"I loved the first single from BO so hopefully the entire album will be good. And has more effort into it than ""WHERE ARE THE JOKES"""
15	Thank you. [NAME]
14	Conversion to make gay people straight. It's horrifying
21	i can change mood for no reason on seconds. Im happy ish. To sad or frustrated to anger and rage and not always in that order.
20	A SWEDISH penis enlarger pump? make sure you read the instructions by austin powers.
18	I’d love to flatten [NAME] emotions.
20	This is what happens when you don’t beat up the nerd enough
11	The way colt talks in that weird calm voice is like a psychopath. I hate it. It’s so condescending and creepy.
9	Meanwhile my sister won’t even hug my goodbye when I drop her off at school.
20	I think [NAME] was pulled in that moment into the “World between Worlds” just as [NAME] on Malachor.
27	[NAME] damn you are autistic
20	They apologized for that episode.
4	I’ll keep the fruits of my labor and my firearms thanks for the cute ideas though, sounds nice til it’s you in the breadline 
3	One good girl is worth twenty hoes - G - Easy
20	Uh oh. CALL THE UK POLICE.
8	"""Someone else must start this however... but I will sure join in the violent fight that will ensue... I promise!"""
6	So are we tanking or are we still trying for playoffs?
20	[NAME] loves [NAME], because [NAME] loves America and protects us from the tyranny of evil men. [NAME] bless [NAME]! [NAME] bless America!
20	I ate my mommy and daddy
20	You are not the only one. I rage quitted UNO
0	We just got a ninja coffee machine. Don’t even need filters! It has little waste besides the coffee grounds. I love it.
20	This says more about what [NAME] thinks about facts than what's true about music.
4	Yeah Eagles definitely had the upper hand in the negotiation but there’s no way we were gonna waste a season with [NAME] at QB.
6	Maybe that's why she was trying to buy a firearm. To lead the fight against the alien invasion.
3	Man we better not lose this like the [NAME] game.
10	That’s part of why I hate porn so much - other than the exploitation of women
20	He claims the starting job and we make the playoffs, I think it would be hard to argue against him.
0	Just stunning my meats
13	Fuck yeah, I eighteenth this. 
14	You're analogies are terrible and prove the opposite of what you were arguing, numb skull 😂
26	I can’t work, wish I could. Worked hard my whole life and lost literally everything a few years ago. 20 years down the drain.
26	Poor and lonely.
17	Volunteer. Helping people in need will make you feel better about both yourself and others.
15	I second that. What goes up must come down. And to OP, i hope you find peace and clarity. Good luck!
1	His laptop lol
20	You just worded it badly, like we all SHOULD want to see it change, which many of us don’t.
20	Exactly right about throwing $23M at Donaldson. I mean, are we going for it this year or not? Mixed signals...
10	Seen plenty of women's marches with so called feminists wearing hijabs even though that is not a symbol of freedom.
14	It bothers me that certain people praise him as an entertainer and could care unless about what he did. Look at [NAME]... Makes me question humanity🤔
9	I used to know a guy back in HS, and college. Every male in his family had been struck by lightning, except him.
10	Shameless karma whoring.
4	Yeah I never tried because I think it's stupid.
15	Thanks for the [NAME] quote.
24	It definitely took a lot of research to figure everything out for myself, but I’m glad I was able to help ya!
15	Hahaha thanks. I didnt notice the spelling dammit. Edited now.
0	You are an amazingly strong person!

7	how many times has this been reposted by now? 10?
6	Eagles fan here. is this goalpost an old meme here? or was it due to recent circumstances?
17	Wow im glad my uncle is dead , this sounds crazy .
10	Yeah this is downright spooky; she's not even using that face mask.
20	I think this guy or gal is the official 2018/2019 Winter Season Dibs Champion
5	Oh that’s so sad that she thinks anyone cares about her opinion
23	Someone made a similar joke and got 500 down votes.
6	So what should I do?? I’ve been dating her for eight years and am confused on what to do please help me.
20	[NAME] “sociopath”.
0	This is a good step. Refusing to vaccinate your kids should be considered child abuse.
18	Me, it's too cute for words.
0	This movie is highly underrated. Part of the problem it has is that Rogue One was SO FREAKING AWESOME!
13	Gonna get a cheeky nandos with the mandem
20	But [NAME], if they invited you there'd be no storyline!!
20	Oh wow, cry me a river. It's not like he's testifying against a [NAME].
6	Oh. It really is [RELIGION]. I was wondering if that was a bad gag.
15	Finally! Now I see what I was doing wrong. PB, thank you!
5	I encourage everyone close to me to inform themselves about my diagnosis if they really care about me.
20	The master will not be pleased.
20	My 35kg ball of quivering nerves, which I am currently wearing like a tea cosy, would like to register an objection. 
15	[NAME] thanks dude
0	My favorite kind of chilled delectable from Georgia. Sort of like candy apples, but crunchier. 
7	What do you mean?
20	But how can a [NAME]?
23	If we change the definition of what we are, maybe women will want to fuck us! -incel logic
20	When he shoved them.
10	No, that means you're actually 41.
20	“Richtofen breaks the cycle!”
23	Phoenix and Orlando are teams I hear sniffing around [NAME] in free agency. Both make sense.
5	May your recovery be swift and your memory of her abuse soon be distant. Safe and happy travels.
4	I like how she spins away it's too late.
20	Hope you had fun atleast; it's amazing to see up close in person compared to the camera.
20	Yeah but being president is the only thing keeping him from being indicted so he’s kinda stuck.
4	Her license hasnt been revoked though ;( If purposefully giving people the wrong medecine isnt enough of a reason then idk what.
20	You do eat off them in very special situations
20	Probably because every day several people ask the same question.
9	It was never implied as such. You simply mistakenly interpreted it that way.
23	I didn't knew people can be so bad until I met a few people online.
4	Well. That's your belief. I know you and the next cant tell me how to raise mine so I'm not worried about all that.
10	"TD: ""You cant just call everyone you dislike a nazi!"" Also TD:"
20	What was that?!
20	I'm not saying anything about her run, I'm talking about her promo pic
0	Good because I've been waiting since September!
6	What? A [NAME] supporter purposefully misrepresenting the facts? You don't say.
6	I think it's your choice that determines it
0	Funny you say that... krav maga is quite popular in Evanston.
20	> On top of that, the article stated that some had even had their IUD ripped out by a partner. BLUUUUUURURRRRRRRGHHHHH WHYYYYYYY
2	The power dynamics argument is one of the most ridiculous arguments ever - unless it’s someone who has a *direct* influence on your life or outcomes.
3	Agreed. I don't know what the middle ground is, but it's somewhere between neglect through inaction and traumatic physical overreaction. 
20	Why not use one pick and get help needed to advance to playoffs rather get late 1st player who will be 2-3 away from roster ?
17	This will pass and you will be happy again. Just not right now. Hang in there.
1	"""joke's on you, I was only pretending"""
20	They started seeling alcohol a while ago, when she called her mafia friend to get help for the speakeasy.
3	I think OD needs a rework. Get rid of that crappy 50% passive and give him some sort of active or a proper passive ability.
14	It's pretty dangerous when the state decides which fictional deity is legitimate. For example the [NAME].....
4	I can do the first bit? I'm also working out lately, so we can do it together!
20	Same here. I kept listening to the damn puns.

5	I will, no worries.
4	[NAME] is legit! Loving this move.
9	What happened that she was so pissed and did this live?
2	your character's so broken!
18	That one is my favorite btw, its delicious. sorry you couldn't have it :(
9	He’s had big games for us before, it’s just his lack of consistency and effort 
15	Thanks for clearing this up!
3	Speaking of not having a brain, that seems pretty ironic coming from someone with your attitude.
20	The very best they could do was the uranium one unscandal, which even [NAME] had too much dignity to touch. 
4	I personally think think life is beautiful but living is hell, kinda like a hurricane can be the most beautiful thing.
20	I didn't downvote you so I couldn't tell yah why. It was definitely infected that's why it was red and swollen.
0	Everyone is reporting about it on TV. Was cool to see the highlight.
4	"Governments aren't generally considered ""monopolies"". You can't have two governments (at the same level). "

20	We are fighting for their autonomy, which is why we're fighting hard for them to be born first.
24	I’m having a counseling this weekend ... nothing to be scared.... just tell them about your feelings and what are you worrying about..
2	Oh damn, I was thinking like what kind of monster doing this
4	Thats the high life of empowerment.
0	It's the great irony of The Resistance©. It's hard to be a rebel when most of the powerful institutions of the country are on your side
0	fuck I meant to put a never in there. I'm glad you picked me up on this before I got put on a subreddit.
14	I love Subnautica. It's so, so terrifying but also beautiful and cool and I can wimp out and put it down any time. 
4	True but stranger things have happened.

14	Yikes that's cringe
7	But you clearly agree with most or some of his ideas, do you not?
18	She gets genuinely emotional sometimes too. I love it. So refreshing
18	I would love to see your evidence for any of this above and below stuff. Go ahead, I'll just wait right here....
10	Same...except that I'm not good looking :
6	Did someone say [NAME] I love or hate her but I love her don’t @ me
10	I'm not gonna lie, I'm guilty of being triggered by people buying NASA shit but don't really care about it. 
20	Those charts seem to indicate approximately a net 4000 advantage for [NAME] over the period considered.
21	Until he leaves for the Lakers and we’re right back in the same spot in two years after not winning shit
20	The miracle was just that. Because we all know the Vikings would fail the next game.
3	"Yeah, but that driver's mistake could have easily seriously harmed or even killed the pedestrian, this is not a ""we all make mistakes"" situation."
18	Yes for sure! Please let me know how your job venture goes! :) would love to hear your experience.

3	You are extremely rude and condescending, and in my opinion it’s sad that you’re a teacher. 
2	It's pretty obvious why they're filming dipshit
20	I mean, you're the one rationalizing for what essentially amounts to a presidential dictatorship.
14	What's the cringe?
20	The original video was debunked. Do you agree or disagree?
1	"To be fair, it is a wild sentence. ""I have genital herpes and a BMI of 31."" As if they're related lol"

10	But what about terminal pulp space infections that can lead to osteomyelitis of terminal phalanx? The reasoning I read was thrombosis of end artery.

4	"Also in response to /u/hyunL. There was. Among other things such as vocally wanting rape to be legalized, ""breeding"" farms, among other things. "
6	Would you mind elaborate on your viewpoints?
5	This is true, but For THIS situation, it's time to take notes on the situation and do better on the next one. She deserves better.
20	He’s creepy
25	sorry, i phrased that wrong. i meant that as a asexual, i get that a lot
20	Me too, me too. But if it’s with anybody but [NAME] piloting the thing, I will cry big salty tears.

1	My sister put her foot into the muddy end of a pond once and thought she was dying. We had to go home. It was hilarious.
20	When [NAME] and [NAME] left because they were a bit too male, I guess. Get woke; go broke.
17	Is...Is this a Hitman themed FE Shitpost?...I dunno whether to be happy or impressed by this.
3	Unbelievable that we didn’t sign him Also, we could’ve potentially signed [NAME] the window we signed [NAME]. Kill me.
20	Can't. Prequel bad. Bearded [NAME] Man idea bad. OT era only good thing.
21	It did put me off at first but after you get better with a weapon it becomes far less of an issue.
18	Literally loving this. Where are all the guys like you irl?!
4	I agree. There was just a big disconnect. They weren't talking specifically about masculinity but about certain situations that are toxic.
4	He believed Ireland had a right to exist, he just didn’t believe in the way the IRA(1919-1921) went about their business. 
0	Nor am I as his servant. Though seeing him happy is awesome!

18	[NAME] is having a great start to the game. Very gritty and I love it. Plz keep him.
20	Loooong way to go in the season. A lot could happen. All we need is bottom 3 for a shot

26	"My adopted daughter told me, ""You can't tell me what to do. You're not my dad."" While true, it still stung."
5	You should make your own listing to showcase exactly this. Should be easy if it's as rampant as you say it is.
0	great! Whats on your mind? Be open about it,
4	You can slice it anyway. If it has sugar or heavy sugar than tax it or go for specific categories like soda and candy etc.

20	Then later, when you're using alcohol to drown your sorrows, at least the guy in the mirror is a friend that you can drink with.
20	It doesn't bother me for some reason, I'm just lactose intolerant.
0	What a bullet, and what a sequence for [NAME]
15	Thanks for calling me an idiot... was definitely necessary.
20	She didn't need that spine.
10	AP can tell them to leave, and then call the cops if they don't. Soliciting/begging is not allowed on Target property. 
10	Ugh obviously that's not what I meant, what I meant is that *socially* if they have a sibling that they do not need humans *socially*. 
20	A place I used to work had this blown up about twelve feet wide. I'd get physically nauseated looking at it

0	Different region of same hellscape. Congrats, good luck!
15	I'm sorry to hear that! But thank you for sharing I imagine several years of not seeing someone you care about would be draining!
2	We won't. If Ireland do they'll be violating the GFA.
8	Ohmigoodness! I've never seen this before! All the gracias to you!
3	It's weird knowing that the people in these pictures are actually real You kinda forget sometimes
10	Isn't that redundant?
10	That's not cute
20	I thought this was a torb skin and I was about to die
10	It's not illegal to be ungrateful. You can't force someone to take care of someone like you're wanting.
0	This is actually really good! Thanks for posting this man!
15	Thanks. I though it was fooling a penquin.
4	Depends on what's causing the hallucinations
15	So far, so good

20	We're ALL what's wrong with this country
23	I think you should manage your hopes and expectations that you have about her. Start dating other people. Let her go
1	It’s a joke.
0	Dogs , unconditional love 
0	Interesting how the before photos are clearly yellow-tinted, as can be seen by the difference in the skin complexion 
3	The thing to understand about [NAME] is that he's a complete moron.
5	Congrats and best wishes. Build on progress.
14	I'll think about prime, just heard a lot of negative about them that spooks me some.
10	Nor are they common in the UK. Never seen one in the middle.
9	“Instagram might suck but it doesn’t suck”
20	Ha. It will start calling my neighbors slurs in no time
20	Clam is what your looking for.
6	We still have this?!!!!!!!! What?!
3	People are barbaric even though they are peaceful? You’re not making any sense.
20	I guess the top left forgot to read the part of history where their ideology failed many times, and killed many people
15	Thank you ☺️
17	I also love this decline in bch prices. Cheers.
20	I'm not ready for that so I won't believe it
13	happy cake day.
23	tf, didnt know that thx
20	BAT OLA?
26	She later drunkenly slipped on her puddle, fell onto the tracks, and was run over. RIP
8	I would stay away from buying from msL. Just remember that [NAME] looks like [NAME] on there. Trying to make a change :-/
20	Lip piercings would be painful bloody and easily pulled out... Nipple piercings hurt tremendously if ripped and are also easily ripped out
15	Oh I didn’t notice the salt before. I’ll leave it out when I made it, thank you!
14	I didn't say it would be impossible to assemble a computer. I said you wouldn't have one because they'd be too scarce and bloody expensive.
20	ill yes, but hater you if you mean from the Southern US

21	Good luck!

4	Time to get new friends. This one clearly doesn’t appreciate you for who you are.
20	This South Florida girl loves Jaxons Ice Cream. Seeing the kitchen sink makes me want to drive home.
27	23 minutes! Omg that's too long
10	This is pretty bad advice. Do not use dreams own encryption. And do not use things such as igolder
11	this is my worst fear
20	You can. I've used my Kroger-linked phone number while travelling to other states with success.
20	Your x and his mother are the only other people there and you’ve gotta work together to bake a cake.
13	[NAME], I love these kinds of threads.
18	I'm loving the possibility of fighting a Chimera in the DLC.
20	But it's her turn!
6	Honestly, I just bought a car with a manual. Sink or swim. Or in that case, drive or walk.
22	felt like that shot by palms was our first in a while
21	I'm in. Hopefully I don't end up on the dumpster fire that is the Oilers
10	I am very thankful for that. And thankful I wasn’t totally brainwashed
20	I don't control the Lib Dems, shockingly.
11	No. No it isn't. Its a bad sitcom joke.

2	Yeah, without the music that scene would have been much worse.
20	On this blessed day, we are all KQLY.
20	Go support them then.

25	Yeah probably should've chosen a better sub, but I couldn't think of one
3	Furry btw so why don’t you take yourself also
1	Haha Not like this in my experience, but I guess it's different in USA
21	The mood changes are semi controllable with medication (at least it’s the case for me). Please seek psychiatric help to get a proper diagnosis.
4	for something to have gone missing it had to have existed in the first place.
20	If your waifu was real she would never love you
9	Didn't even realize that the Mazda was a competition. It's always a Camry and Accord.
4	i’m with you bro best of luck🤞🏼

2	I hate those days man... So triggering
12	I never knew cringing could be so ...cathartic.
20	He's not an island he has support and help some are powerful friends. I imagine he takes the fight to [NAME] after this

11	Worst radio ever.

10	Can't jab him outta this wind up unblockable lol
4	Can't tell how cold it is if the battery is completely dead. RollSafeMeme.jpeg
20	But you've been openly critical of men's rights and have defended feminism.
4	The clothing comes in individual plastic bag from manufacture, but I do agree with the plastic packaging for the jewelry. That amount of plastic is unnecessary.
5	Yeah but good luck proving it in court
6	I thought he was a candidate as a [NAME] when [NAME] left. What happened to that.
23	I'm sorry, no. The hostess was 15. I was 24. At the steakhouse, only hostess girls answered phones.
4	He's 34 years old.
6	I believe they use some tissue from the urethra that creates some small amount of lubrication.
15	Thanks I will try to delete the multiples. Good luck on everything.

7	Ohhhhh that couple!

25	Ooooof, that’s annoying. I’m sorry.
18	I REALLY love martini glasses. But not this much.

2	up shut fuck the
1	It’s never been good lol
21	Buddy I think you may have been wooooshed..
26	Probably. The fact his reaction to you being injured was to go off and have sex with a stranger is not a healthy sign.
2	You're just a fuming democrat and all I hear is angry democrat mental gymnastics.
20	He's likeable but the pace of a game on live tv is too much for him. He'd definitely be better suited as a halftime guy
3	He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting!
11	[NAME]
20	Marry her!
9	What a nasty goal! Gives you chills!

20	And none of them give a damn about the [NAME]. Very telling.
9	I mainly play EDH. Did try standard at one point as well but lost interest
20	"""I'm a lady! I do ladies things!"" He's a real life [NAME]!"
26	You wont be in pain but you wont feel any relief either. Find what makes you feel comfortable and stick with it
23	Well he abused his previous girlfriend, he ran a porn site that's what I know
15	I borrowed an old wedding dress from a museum. It was a one size fits all kind of dress. Thank goodness!
21	You’re so close:) hope you can get one
4	I'm referring to leadership and there's been several headlines about it already in the last week or so.
20	And you can't really see the bottom part so that's probably small too. Really grosses me out
3	I can't really provide anything to you that you haven't already deliberately misread yourself. I can't force you to be honest.
7	Would you give your used underwear to your best friend/romantic interest? >!I know I have.!<
4	This is genius. The ultimate prank.
20	I'm actually amazed we walked away with 2 points. That 2nd was one of the worst periods I've watched. [NAME] stole that period.

25	The problem is your husband. If he prioritized you, he would have figured something out. I’m so sorry.
3	And the douche social media obsessed guy who left the used condom on the side table!
21	I always hope that a woman will ask me out...next time it happens will be the first.
20	That was at Nats Park. I remember that poor guy.
8	She still cute tho
0	Glad she reads the comments of every [NAME] Facebook post ever
4	The best one for me is still Borderlands 2, and it’s been a fucking while. Amazing how far ahead of its time that game was.
20	Long, difficult but rewarding combos. Simple defense mechanics. The speed it’s currently at. Meter burns, risk reward. 
0	That guy at the start with the hat reminds me of [NAME]
20	* Make sure you've got more than enough to eat at home
20	Honestly I thought it just meant any game where you couldn't choose Casual mode... which is everything pre-Awakening.
4	That's because he played the end of the game when they were feeding [NAME] with no results.
15	Thanks all. It was a league game in our local bar. The dealer rotates on each hand. Lesson learned from me.
6	most conservatives have been pissed at cities in Minnesota raising the age to buy tobacco, I guess i'm a little confused on what you are talking about.
10	These are worse than the [NAME] ones [NAME]
17	But, it entertains you.... in some way. Thats the point dude.
1	[NAME] 😂 I’m sorry they weren’t as expected but thank you for sharing! I had a good giggle.
20	Wow they are on the cusp here. Definitely not fellowkids because I would totally believe an actual fellow kid said this
20	STAY TO THE RIGHT
7	What no one in the history of time has ever recovered from a bad first date? Hard pass on this anecdotal evidence.
15	Take a upvote I'm glad I made your experience great
20	When it's the same composer, this kind of thing is bound to happen.
4	Yeah, and I always thought the dude in these comics was supposed to be like 30 years old. 
4	Low life is as low life does. I wouldn't be too surprised if he's broke by the time he's middle aged, unfortunately.
5	Do you remember if [NAME] was carrying a white piece of paper? Oh yeah...you don't forget a thing like that...
3	Woooooooooo it took long enough but the UYU boys finally did it and made the league
0	Ok, thanks for the clarification. I don't find it compelling but I appreciate your time and patience.
4	Wait, this is an actual music video you're describing, and not like... a Family Guy bit?
15	Thank you! :)
3	This is not a good formation. We’ve been over this. It just ends up being crossed lobbed into the box by [NAME]
4	Does your son do Scratch? My daughter doesn't do fortnite but Scratch is her favourite internet thing and she would love to add new scratch friends.
24	Thanks for saying that, it wasn't easy ... definitely sparked a long period of discussion and reflection!
20	That would never pass since every side would get what they want. There has to be a loser in his eyes
20	not sure why people are downvoting you saying youre a hurricane fan
20	You people.
10	His sentences don’t contradict. You just have poor comprehension.
4	You’re right but territories haven’t been around for decades
13	I remember running into teachers at the grocery store or whatever when I was a little kid and having that same feeling!
18	Genoa likes [NAME]
6	You guys actually look really similar to me besides the hair/beard. But that's not a bad thing!
1	Hahahaha. This. This right here. 😂
20	Same, I just want to see her get eaten by a flamingo on rollerskates
10	Ha, my husband goes out after you guys have done your thing and checks for himself, he's been burned too many times.
2	What the hell are you on about now? Those are some weird examples to go with your clarified opinion.
3	Sweaty irritates me. But Its not exactly drag lingo. I've seen it on so many other subs too.
20	Sexy Unique Podcast (SUP) for all your VPR needs!
20	The old bear
20	Best way to fight it is to fight it in every way.
21	No problem, hope things get better for you guys soon!
0	You are a true hero
17	His Batman/TMNT book is a really fun read with great art.
20	A 12 million sub channel has value. Wouldn't be surprised if it's been hollowed out ready to be sold and rebranded.
3	His chin is recessed. How the fuck does he have decent lower face
17	im glad they have it but this should have really been introduced in DMC3
13	It’s a party and we’re all invited
4	Woah. This is a whole new fascinating Reddit thing that I never knew about
10	I mean yeah that's really it. Getting him on tape saying racist stuff is the only possibility of a sale.
20	If New Jersey are going to win it in the winter they better get something done quickly..
7	Why do you think he's right? What reason would a nonprofit newsroom have for publishing sensationalist headlines?
20	Psst...If no one sees you while eating it, you didn't actually eat it
20	It's pinned on the sub.
2	> She fucked my bumper up and I will forever hate her And her insurance didn't repair it because???
13	My favourite moment of the game by my favourite player.
10	> [NAME] That is going to get sooo confusing if he does join our division.
21	I just walked past y'all! Wish I had seen this thread earlier.
0	Oh, but amazingly it seemed to work out in the end because oil eating bacteria evolved in the Gulf of Mexico
3	OH SUCK ME SIDEWAYS
0	[NAME] looks wayyyyyy happier to be there than he did at the Columbus press conference last week.
20	Too right. I hate the Sun. worst tabloid out there
3	The oldest Millennial is 38, so mot surprising you don't know how
20	It’s cheaper to track her phone.
20	Cognitive dissonance. I don't support diagnosis via internet but she needs medical help NOT a medical license.
10	Surely the error is lexical. And I think the original comment is poor (non native) idiom use
10	Honestly, I wouldn’t want to poop without my phone either. Gotta scroll reddit while I’m poopin!
20	Have you actually seen the pictures of her scratches? There’re not on her stomach at all, they’re on her side and back.
3	> I don’t understand the boot-licking mentality Calling it in 5 years. That's your future AP.
10	Love this game, can't stand the combat system. It's just not for me. 
15	Sweet thanks for the update. I hope the kitty finds a good home
8	Then let's go scythe and HAMMER!!! I've actually wanted scythe and hammer for the longest too
4	Kids Day in Toronto, Leafs STHs donate their tickets to kids so there's like 10,000 kids in the arena today. Pretty cool thing they started last year
11	Terrible shade of lipstick she's wearing...
20	"""Don't eat pork! Not even with a fork!"""
20	OP literally said guys like [NAME] are not unicorns and not hard to find. They never said [NAME] was the ultimate standard lol
25	I stand corrected, my apologies to the mods. I'd personally like to see more banned or removed but at least they handled the most egregious.
10	Nope. Just running from people wielding axes like a normal person. Instead of acting like a tough guy on the internet like you.
5	Just remember to refrigerate it and not leave it out.
2	I DON'T KNOW. The loneliness goes from mental pain to physical discomfort and pain.
18	[NAME] my favorite character 🤣
15	Good point. Thank you. My condolences for your own loss.
21	Oh sorry dude, I was just looking for the WiFi password. [NAME], but I hope you stay safe
13	You sound like my gf. I'm so lucky to have her in my life.

0	This post is amazing. Definitely starting to see good days and life just kept improving after my Nex. Thank you for this
21	I think she said he hit her through the car window
8	there needs to be a win, fail or something related to alcohol. Theres none; just a girl dancing and you faping:
17	Congratulations, it is satire!
20	Tucking your jeans into your sock makes you look like a goober...
20	Go find your own [NAME]!!!
15	Yes. Exactly. Anything non [NAME] belongs in the trash. Glad you agree.
3	I mean clearly it's because they don't understand the pricing for babies/young children on the black market.
11	It definitely revealed how ugly the hatred on the Left has gotten.
20	I have even gotten to have sex with women who were fellow comics nerds and also hated what movies have done to [NAME] stories!
24	That's how you think hes trying to input something. Glad it was my way home.
20	This is one of the identity issues I was referring to in my original comment.
3	I dropped him around week 6 and let somebody else deal with that headache
15	Congratulations on your shiny spine! I really hope your boyfriend backs you up but even if not, we all do! 
21	Im looking for this, but I predict a 3-1 win to barça. I really hope [NAME] doesnt bore me
4	I can easily relate to that as well. The siblings are the ones who will stick with us for the whole journey to the very end.
0	So you are officially saying that record cabinet was not searched prior to the day the key was found? Is this correct?
20	Knew it before I clicked, top notch movie 
20	So which is more profitable for producers, brick n mortar or digital distribution? Which makes more money?
3	Sick comeback. Not really a dirty combo other than the unblockable.
10	I don’t even like [NAME] that much but she completely failed to engage with his work critically. Her interpretations of his arguments were shockingly poor.
2	i just don’t think we are aggressive 100% of the time
6	If I'm just reading the headline, it's ambiguous.
20	Everyone forgot to tell you the 1st step is to marry the Sheriff's daughter.
15	That’s cool. I didn’t know they had cameras like that. Thank you for sharing :)
20	Mod like that should get doxxed honestly.
18	A few months ago I would have loved that idea. Hard pass now.
0	Beautiful shots. Makes me want to finally take the jump into photography.
1	I was dying when he said we got to make love or be a crime
0	As an autism mum, I can’t thank you enough. ❤️
9	the force awakes wasn't a clear insult, it was just mediocre.
3	Ah, so you're the reason people hate aspies. 
1	No. And not near as much as a gun lol
20	I came I saw He broke His jaw
21	My thoughts exactly, I hope [NAME] doesn't get too much hate.
20	And he's also in the way of playing time for [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]. [NAME] fits better as third option on a playoff team.
3	It's not something i'm proud of, but I definitely fucked up that day.
7	>Feminism is how we get to equality how do you know that?
20	Aye me, it's shite and the folk who follow it all think there cool, bore off
15	Cool, thanks man
20	AND MY ~~AXE~~ MACE
6	I’d want to know what happens after
13	I really love that game. It's so chill, I played it a lot. 
7	Frankly, partisan politics aside, I would REALLY like to know where this fever dream of historical came from. It's mind boggling.
8	I wish I can go 90 days challenge
20	I'm just reminding everyone. you're not helping the situation by being pedantic
3	We're not exactly short on white homophobes either though.
9	Gold Coast seems like it would go well on paper, but turn up to the actual thing and seems strangely disappointing would be good to tell friends about though
11	[NAME] said it best. Un-fuckin-believable bro
15	Thanks for a different perspective, this made me feel better.
1	very long very messy i usually have it in a bun to keep it under control lol
14	i did, but it was at 3 am before i went to bed, so i’m gonna cheat and count it as 2018 LOL.
20	Baby dont misunderstand..why cant I be head coach
11	"ick! That makes me feel gross. I have ""Addison's Disease"". "
20	That'll cost ya.
5	our first series against the dbacks on may 31 may be too painful :c but i hope he finds great success there!!
20	Rip ok lol
15	Make sure to tell her /r/Austin helped you pick a place! She'll appreciate the thought you put into choosing a place special to her.
5	Will provably be downvoted into oblivion but you could have used *people* instead of *monsters* and have the point remain intact. Edit: Probably*
7	Is that so bad?
20	Didn't know about him being a teacher. Camp Bucca doesn't mean much though. Plenty of foreign fighters ended up in those type of camps.
0	Very wholesome!
5	I'm worried that [NAME] throwing away a future career by running for President.
9	Pulisic is a replacement for our abysmal right wing.
7	i’ve heard its convenient if its a particularly messy job
20	assault? molest just has a connotation of someone being under the influence or without proper faculties
10	Trust me it gets worse from there....i shortened it a lot
20	It would seem difficult to say you're living in one city when you're only applying there to expand your reach.
20	They have a local government which governs their reserve, which is elected democratically. It’s their government, it represents them not anyone who is non-indigenous
21	You can't stop [NAME], you can only hope to contain him
20	I actually really like [NAME]
4	A Visa gift card is a type of Visa card, and you can return money to it just like you can with any other Visa card.
20	We need to fight both opression and the SJWs guys, they don't know the struggle of peeing with a boner
20	Arrow already did break this trend by having a mostly excellent S5, definitely much better than S3 and S4.
4	Look how pretty she is. YES QUEEN YESSSSSSS
4	Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
20	huge fool just like everyone who believes anything [NAME] says weve been two weeks away for months now
17	This makes me smile.
20	That's [NAME] and he had a concussion.
10	Those dont seem exclusive....try both
7	[NAME], I guess you are the one who got whooshed
20	You're way too involved in this. Take a break from the internet.
20	That's my horse!
20	I was going for r/truthtoirony
9	No, though they've been criticised for an alleged anti-gov't bias. 
0	That makes sense. You had a good reaction time. Glad no one was hurt.
26	True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams.
1	Naw man Asain men have an easier time. Most of my asain friend are pretty boy. Fuckbois lol
1	Haha okay. Much love brother!
20	Why should I care what he thinks?
10	Just say that you don't like it. It tastes of blood, tears, and death.
21	errr, nah she'll be dead in both without compesations. less than 40% winrate.
4	I forgot the Olympics was gonna happen there 😂 hopefully the signs and stuff will stay!
20	Ssssssh, don't tell them. It's a natural way to filter the gene pool from stupid people. 
20	> I’m tired of being realistic and open minded. Me too! Now it is all about being selfish and aloof. Not even kidding.
26	and as soon as I said ni IPAD tonight, I was like GIRL what the fresh hell is tonight gonna bring! 
20	You'd have to explain what that means to you first. It's such a nebulous phrase it's never meant much of anything to me.
7	Anyone have that mirror?
20	You have no idea how high I can fly.
20	Also: - more snipers - another stealth hero This makes my top 3 of what would make the game even more fun.
1	Also likely selling stolen goods too lol
6	I'm not. He and I still thrive. I hope you're doing alright.
18	Been together 6 years, and I think she's the best person I know. I'm still in the phase where I love her more everyday.
1	Keep on auto aiming bud. One day you'll get good maybe haha.
20	Mine was apparently [NAME] and the giant peach!
9	Yeah I messed up, gonna repost this with better quality in the near future
20	You can replace the ram / SSD now on the new Razer blade 15 but ya razer sucks.
2	Yeah suck it, California
17	Well, my upcoming adverts are going to be interesting!
1	Well then town is flummery for not guilty'ing the mafia lol
11	Me too. Scorpion sounds so odd now
20	TALK TO HER TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL
6	That and hoping the cultists on trumps side can give them enough time to get out before it all goes down in flames, your country that is.
20	If you do, the defecation will impact the rotary oscillating atmospheric circulation device.
20	I just spit out my drink If I had money I would gold you I’m dead r/JesusChristReddit
0	That’s because she is. Honestly she’s done like a ‘safe’ performance once and the rest high. Others are unfortunately her eliminaysh-ions
3	Crows get hungry too you know and it's not like you were sharing
27	Omg I had to crank my tv because I thought it was just low volume
4	I agree with you! Just wishful thinking from me I guess aha!
20	Disturbing =/= awful. Its incredibly well done by a professional. I feel like this sub is more for unintentional awfulness, not purposeful shock value/ theatrical makeup.
1	Some people are pretty dense. That comment was clearly sarcasm, sorry bout your downvotes 😔
20	the libertarian to fascist pipeline is real
20	Not a particularly in-depth article, but I thought it was a worthwhile follow-up to the recent post about police ticketing people outside Tim Hortons.
20	"That's even cheaper than I had figured.. there's still the ""to you"" bit... OP needs to post an Amazon wishlist."
5	Because [NAME] had a foot injury that I think he sustained at practice for the second half of the year.
7	Who was it? I got here after it was deleted, and I'd like to read the comment history.
4	Not everyone is as Europhilic as you, and that’s okay.
2	CAN IT JUST BE OPENING DAY? I’m so sick of speculation. Let’s quit the foreplay and just fuck already.
0	Nice Sir !
13	Maybe. It's an interesting theory for sure :)
18	I would love to watch you become jaded by [NAME].
1	She was funny with [NAME] in the previous BFQOE I think. I honestly think she needed a better partner in this episode
1	Haha enjoy your life sweaty. Haha
17	a romantic one :)
20	Well hello Mr. [NAME].
4	Yeah, neither of them are communists. [NAME] is a left-leaning [NAME] and [NAME] is a [NAME]
4	I think we would be interested in seeing how something like this would work. Would you post the information? Send notifications? I'm curious.
20	"Ask an Imam what they think... ""Oh that's okay. It's their culture!"""
1	Damn Skyrim VR looks amazing.
10	Some Leftist ideologies frown upon SocDems as counterrevolutionary. Don’t agree with it, but that’s the thought process.
12	So it’s somehow weird or different to make a child/student pick up their (there) own mess as part of the lesson?
20	Predicted almost exactly what was going to happen. Still got me.
20	Oh. Makes sense.
2	Fuck that guy for game 2
20	Ohio is weird.
20	ALL THE TIME
0	You're far too sweet haha
1	Lmao that [NAME] damn nic cage pillow
13	Wow, he showed some backbone. I’ve always been pretty ambivalent towards him, but this ups my opinion a little.
18	"Gotta love the ""its a metaphor"" guy, who has apparently never read any other comments by [NAME]"
0	She’s like a kewpie doll with them. Precious.
20	Spending my first day ever in Europe. In Oslo, with an amazing girl I met visiting Texas from Norway about a year ago. 
2	Why don't you just move to secular country like North Korea, China or Sweden? Leave theists alone we don't want you.
20	The DPRK is ethno fascism
9	They didn’t you lying sack of shit. This sub has no moderators.
27	I was wondering that as well....
2	No you said communism is a more extreme form of socialism.
4	Damn, u right. 
0	That would have been cool for sure
20	Let's be real though, the waifu is probably younger than his kidfu
20	Quick way to get deactivated there buddy.
20	They have THE BEST tortillas too. Made right in front of you. Mmmmmm!
20	Check that rabid post history lol
9	Our knight in shining armor. I'll miss those high socks
14	I'm afraid of having a sit down with them amd not being heard. But I might have to for my safety.
20	Damn... this weed is the shiznittlebamsnipsnapsack!
11	Horrendous , this is also reflected in my experience act school where you are not allowed to defend yourself at all 
10	I don't even love myself that much. I'm glad I wrote myself out of the parenting pool long ago, I'd be terrible at it.
20	My worry about [NAME] is that running former governors hasn’t worked out the greatest. Especially when his been out of office for 11 years.
27	It continually amazes me how many people don't understand this.
20	you're curious.
7	"Do people really use the phrase ""my kid is poorly"" to mean sick? The grammar in this post is really bothering me."
13	Oh [NAME] I love [NAME]!
10	How? That’s silly. Clearly Lowries impact is higher.
0	"That ""Hard work"" usually involved the junkrat pressing Q so I'm not about to shed tears"
3	I just learned this with your comment. Came to ask who granted [NAME] legistaice powers
10	The sin was refusing to impregnate his brother's widow when [NAME] directly told him to. It's not just about wasting semen.
0	I wish I could upvote this a million times. What a wonderful tack to take.
12	The guy who thought of this chokes the chicken.
4	Great shot, from experience very difficult. 
4	hmmm sounds vaguely familiar.
21	Why not? Just go for it. It'll make a great story to tell at your 50th wedding anniversary party.
20	That’s not what I said, but ok. 
0	Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good
20	Feels like bathing in warm piss. Can't wait until summer is over.
1	Jokes aside, welding is so fucking fun, and they get paid damnnnn well.
20	Both sides have extended offers to end the shutdown since it has started, I think it's disingenuous to act like this is completely one sided. 
20	You should eat real cake today too!
27	I'll chase you till the ends of the eaaaaarth, Shooooooooooooooooooooooooooocker!!!!!!!
20	Guess Isco should never start then. I think opposite effect then
20	I feel this!
17	Happy to be able to help.
26	Yeah definitely not like my welder boyfriends hands for sure
1	Opposite for us! My fiance cuddles me because it helps him fall asleep, then I can play video games in bed!
4	Yep, though we just had a cross on the stochastic RSI weekly chart, looks like the next four to six weeks are going to get nasty.
20	Margin of error: 0.7%
20	Check out [NAME], he's like the [NAME] of dissosiatives. 
15	Thanks for this. I was about to relapse but am still going strong.
9	I would of taken a shit in the woods real quick
14	Imagine being scared of a black bear
20	"What part of ""Yeah but still"" do you not understand dude?"
17	And I like the taste
2	I just realized, what point are you trying to argue here? Because I have no idea where you're trying to go with this conversation.
20	I meant the first part. The second part was uncalled for.
27	Wow! You are lucky to have survived!
15	i just wanted to thank you. it took long to find a place where i can voice my thoughts
20	I loved [NAME]. She was too fine. [NAME] and [NAME] too. S1 babes were the best.
5	Cheers. Never heard of any of them. Kids will do that to you...
20	Sometimes those are the only options. Laughing makes other people feel better at least so that's what you gotta do.
17	"My nmom always says ""Well, you learned from it!"""
0	22s. Good save. Doing [NAME] work.
21	If [NAME] goes back to the Nationals their lineup and rotation are going to be nasty! I'm still hoping he lands outside of the division.
23	Ah, that's why they say don't run in the corridor
20	Actually you're a [NAME] if you aren't for exterminating the 'wrong inherently evil and guilty race'.
20	Ha! I actually included that on purpose, was poking fun at me (and the typical MS3) :)
20	Sounds racist, fetishistic, sexist, and objectifying.
22	I wish [NAME] was fit enough to be fourth choice.
20	..how is he not? better == good
20	Forget the prison, use his own guns on him. 
0	That actually looks so fire
18	As far as I know that’s why the military loves it. Plus the [NAME] use it for food occasionally.
6	so what are we now? 4-1 in our last 5?
21	"From what im seeing. ""The democrats can stop this if they just let him build the wall. Its their fault."""

9	oh, my bad
20	Treat your wife like gold. Feed her well. Rub her feet. Repeat.
8	I thought [NAME] was awesome tonight. That kid is passing on another level. I'd love to see that kid saucing up [NAME] on the PP unit
20	Remindme! 5 months
6	What mental illness am I displaying?
2	Why it's bad for a union rep to be siding with ownership in the middle of a contract dispute on Twitter of all places?
20	r/UNBGBBICHIDICTICBG Pretty sure I got that wrong but I think you guys know what I mean Edit: I can't spell
20	What I'm saying g is this is really on the edge of being a that happened I mean it could be partially true
4	I think you're right. She has oodles of cash and young grandchildren to enjoy. Going through that hideous gauntlet again probably isn't that appealing.
20	Go back to class and show you're English teacher yore post. They'd have notes for ewe.
20	I can see Smileyboye receiving a [NAME] award a few years down the line.
20	I like [NAME] but she fucking sucks right now for the all star game haha.
20	[NAME] is that guy downvoting everyone who doesn't think we should draft him.
0	You seem like a well adjusted individual
6	How is this long AF? It's like 20 seconds reading.
3	Yikes. Was he unfamiliar with the area? How did it go over at work?
6	It was the largest defeat since the 20s wasn’t it? Soz am only now catching up so may have misunderstood
23	If you want to start a family, you can't just pass up 20k no matter how nice your current school is. 
20	I thought from his accent maybe he was or he'd spent a lot of time there.
9	A few years ago a lot of shows tried to do a “second screen experience”. It didn’t work and died a quiet death.
21	I really hope your marriage is healed and can become stronger than ever.
2	Dont keep your mouth shut.
20	They want to play the best team to learn the most.
20	“ nice try”
23	i didn't know this could happen.
20	Ironic. He could save others from secrecy-enabled corruption, but not himself.
0	[NAME] looks queasy already I like where this is going
3	When everyone is lying who are you supposed to believe ?
2	Horribly fake. People on that thread are stupid and gullible.
4	Since we've already established that we're talking about the present at this point and not the future, you can just pity the current generation of kids.
0	Triple P Positive Parenting Program is excellent.
0	The bus loop was never going to entice families to transfer their kids to city schools. Is it great for kids already there? Yes.
0	I enjoyed hardcore mode much, much more than regular mode in BF4. More realistic
4	The longest in the southern hemisphere. I always take visiting friends and relatives here, hit them with that fact, and they love it.
27	That has some amusingly unfortunate implications for those that believe all [NAME] are descendant from [NAME], son of [NAME] and [NAME]. 
15	Thank you UsurperRebellion, very cool!
3	Weird crowd.

23	I remember thinking how smart I was then. /s
6	i dont, whats that
0	AWWWWW, look at the little snowflake that can’t take cyberbullying and thinks others care!
1	Haha, I feel that
10	I like, don't like it!
17	I’d prefer happy little trees
4	Yah a couple years been together for 7 total...we are in healthcare
9	Fair enough but I would imagine it's a small enough number that we can deal with. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater...pun intended
20	What the fuck. Got that song on repeat right now
1	The point is, 9gag is more focused in providing fun and entertainment, Reddit is too busy changing the world.
20	I hope your pastor issues are resolved quickly and that your new pastor inspires you.
6	WHAT A SHIFT!!! Can't stop that zone.

4	You are a Filipino leprechaun
0	Holy shit, that's great!

2	Mr [NAME] is operater as fuck
9	Yea it’s custom, me and a friend of mine were messing around seeing what we could sit on...
18	I love it when people assume things.
10	oh man that actually sounds gross in that context
6	Maybe I have inaccurate memories re: Carolina and Boston is a better third
20	Apophenia is a symptom of mental illness and makes you prone to believing conspiracy theories and seeing connections that aren't there.
11	Honestly I’ve seen kids that age do really gross stuff
2	Brooklyn-Boston playoffs would be the most toxic thing of all time. Only Sixers-Cs would be worse
20	"""In Scotland, the word 'fuckin'' is just a warning that a noun is on the way"" -[NAME]"
20	It reminded him too much of being in bed with [NAME]
20	[NAME] and [NAME] may be stronger, but [NAME] just gone mad. She's lost the plot for sure.
4	I feel like [NAME] would have laughed at it though. It was a one-liner. I thought it was funny.
9	Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
20	Prove me wrong then. Find another poll that supports your narrative. Until that point my source is what we have to go by.
20	I always have the subtitles on. So I don’t miss a single 💎!
20	ITLL BE OKAY MOUNTAIN FRIEND, JUST ACCEPT IT

0	Wow .. this is more terrifying than if they were a ghost ! Amazing twist
20	Well, this is the first time I've seen that in over three years.
11	It's a lot of projection. Pretty much anything they point fingers at others for, is something they're guilty of.
20	"Presumably he was more excited about making her stay with some pedo jerkoff fantasy of ""Stockholm Syndrome"" .. oh she's staying cuz she looooooves me! "
20	I’ll let you believe that for now. You’ll see what I mean in 3-5 years Have a nice night stranger
10	BPA not fit especially when we dont have a good team
7	That’s fair, I disagree with you, but I’m not here to change your mind. Was just curious. 
1	Hahaha, they are so lost
20	Oh now I get what you mean😂😂
0	What a refreshing question and topic of discussion. 👏 NOT 🙄 *“Discuss.”*
6	You just keep playing games until provisional is over, you can't lose lp during this time and gain big lp (I think?)

5	I have but one upvote to give, otherwise you would get more.
1	Lol, some guntards stepped out of the echo chamber and sounded completely unhinged.
15	Ofcourse. If you can debunk our arguments and stuff,, well you win. Have a nice day too
15	Thank you :)
20	Yup, even if they had a very rough life... Nobody ages thaaaaaat badly.
11	No. It’s not. This is disgusting behavior and anyone who supports it is a fool.
15	Thank you, this isn't the first time they have tried to control us with money. They always put odd stipulations on money or gifts.
2	I was, and it's not. He's mad that someone posts articles he disagrees with. Pathetic and his fury is deranged 
9	I moved from Chicago to Indianapolis a couple years ago. Nobody shovels their sidewalks here. Nobody. It's pure horror.
20	Are we sure this isn't the beaverton?
20	Watch it and find out. Go in with a fresh mind.

14	it's horrid :/
15	Thank you. I will look into the protein possibility.
0	Sexy teeth.
20	Its cause of [NAME] and the Rams, he basically has 0 control over the defense 
20	I’m gonna make that a sub. Too many juicy targets not to.
3	I will take it a as serious question. Sorry. I am in Europe
7	Oh I can feel the burn all the way from Australia, even a few months later. Doesn't anyone have a direct source to this post? Thanks
23	No helmet + no shoes + no skill + no sense = exactly what happened
25	Oh... I'm sorry. You holding up okay?
4	You could feel all his life flowing into your body

0	Interesting to see the bulk of people in that thread are pretty anti-[RELIGION].
2	#I HATE BOTH EQUALLY
20	Yeah I was talking about a pug right there.
20	All the scumbags around everywhere. Sucks that it's so easy to use for a lot of other things.
10	If so, then LN payments are *not* safer than unconfirmed TXs.
4	Maybe I should tell my family to move the Lavvo further south =) people sound nicer there
5	Heres some well wishes to you staying up
3	"It's ""soaked, frostbitten chic!"""
20	Takes all characteristics, good and bad 
27	I’ve never heard of a vet adopting out pets before.
8	"I loved the first single from BO so hopefully the entire album will be good. And has more effort into it than ""WHERE ARE THE JOKES"""
14	We used to do a lot of terrible shit in the past that’s not a good argument
10	And [NAME] should go sell his wife's ketchup. He's good for nothing else besides selling out our country.
13	Agree. I did enjoy Godless but I was addicted to The Terror. It was full of such amazing character actors.
20	me too. it's a way of keeping distance. feels too intimate to use someone's name.
19	Please treat me with modern medicine. I have gastroparisis.
13	Another sick burn! You're fun when you're wrong.
20	Well who knows Germany was way ahead of its time
20	It wouldn't interest me at all, unfortunately.
0	Audio version as well.
20	They'll just move. There is no amount of enforcement that will change that. The United States isn't the only nice place to live.
12	[NAME] face be like: “When you wish you stayed home instead of being embarrassed in front of 100+ million people...”
0	I thought you were just going to wait her out. You actually engineered her loss of space to someone else. WELL DONE!!!!
10	[NAME] doesn’t roll his ankle on a 🎾 in 2011 and we win a premiership imo
15	>I'm just trying to be respectful of the native speakers who did and who prefer it. Literally no one, because it's a made up word
9	I use to get this but now I just get ghosted.
20	Well the last time we got a premier like this, the conservatives didn't get power again until [NAME] and only because [NAME] misstepped at the last second
0	I was entertained into the 4th. My sons played well. We lost. I'll take it.
7	Wait, what? [NAME] wasn't allowed a *bank account*?
0	I like mother lode in weho. A bit loud but actively un-douchy.
2	He was aggrieved that people didn’t recognize him and recognized steroid users instead.

5	Please, just open your heart with us and tell us your thoughts.
20	Get that hole ready for some bricks.
9	Wrong on so many levels. Just sit back and watch it implode. It will hurt at first, but guarantee, you will have the last laugh. 
2	"Comments like these are the biggest reason I get so pissed off about fucking centrists crying about the ""both sides"" argument. "
21	I hope google does this so that everyone would leave them already.
3	What absolute garbage
5	Your mental health matters the most. You can't help him more than you do, but you can help yourself. 
20	Glad I tend to post pics of my cats and not myself.
21	Bran flakes is your friend. Low in calories, and best ‘motivator’ to use the toilet
2	You die.
3	The new beserker face ruined him for me. Made him another old, wrinkly hobo.
13	Can't wait for episode 5
20	Ugh. People are the worst!
7	I wonder if it's about a t t e n t i o n s e e k i n g . . .
10	So deport the bad guys and let the asylum seekers come in. Sounds like we don’t need a wall anyway.
1	"When he read ""don lemon still has a job"" as an example of racial stupidity... I fucking fell out of my chair. LMAO. Love it."
14	watching [NAME] attempt hook shots gives me a panic attack, even when he makes them (which is rare)
3	I bet you get tired of people looking through your post history and using your anti-semitism to dismiss you as utter trash too.
15	Thanks for the sharing your information.
9	Ah! That's not gone well!
11	I hadn’t even noticed the hairline, was too busy looking at the rest of the awful stuff going on.
0	That whole video was very interesting, thank you for that!
3	you are delucional.
4	We have a lot of people flying in and out of the country. No change to the usual lines, so not bad at all.
17	Glad your boss backed you up
23	Greatest part of that goal is the pique backheel for me. What is he even doing there :))
9	>[NAME] Well he forgot to save me from the 'word of hella'.
20	Silence and For Greater Glory
1	Always take a chance on the dork. We rock in general l. There are a few weirdos hut by and large dorks have it together.
20	Hahaha how old are your sons? They're mixin' batches with your body wash hahaha
17	I'm not your buddy, friend. Btw, enjoy the rumble you nice dude. 
20	Problem is the people who don’t know the difference between a single solid yellow and a double solid yellow...
5	Since they only do 6 a year now I would rather it be somone more exciting and surprising
2	[NAME] a bastard man
0	Yup, he's still one of the strongest turtles in the game though. Eventually you're gonna have to attack.
9	You basically already know the entire series for how much they've talked about it and how brazenly they spoil it.
8	This right here is the kind of father I want to be. Thanks for that.
19	Same.. If I'm particularly stressed out someone just walking down the same road as me feels like they're invading my space.
13	Welcome to my world. fml
15	That was helpful to hear, thanks for your response! 
20	This wait is killing me . I don’t even care about the Super Bowl.
0	He looks like he smells of cheese
2	Damn it!
1	I was just joking...
13	When is the battle point for squad spawning back?
20	As far as I can tell that's not real. No announcement yet and people on twitter saying it's false
23	Wow, I’m going to have to remember this one...
0	UNLIMITED POWER!
26	The customer’s a jerk but you’re really not very clear here.
0	honestly I dig it, though [NAME] could rock it better than anyone ever could!

4	Lol omg yesssss. Probably the best suggestion anyone ever told me 🙌🏼

14	Nononononoyes their doing this knowing that they are going to kill the bull no matter what, he deserves it.
18	I love it. The only thing faker than their lies is them. I’m glad the girl was able to get her divorce.
21	But he is just anti Israel and definitely doesn’t hate [NAME]. /s
20	This picture is as old as Tinder. OP is probably a dog for all we know.
21	This report is going to be bullet proof
20	[NAME], 2020 OKC 1st, 2019 CLE 2nd For [NAME] and [NAME] A little filler required to get it done (possibly [NAME] or [NAME])
2	Your mom is being ridiculous. It's not a bid deal, she's taking out frustration with something else on you, maybe. 
20	Didn't know they sell pro bowl jerseys.
9	I work on a farm. I can confirm can be dangerous. I have a hard time imagining a scenario where being a cop is more dangerous.
20	The staff there know what they're talking about whether or not you're making money, no matter how difficult will be huge. you are not alone.
1	It's funny cause OP is trying go against the mindset that most men are predators but in inadvertently reinforcing it :/ awkward.
11	Of course these are all conspiracy theory shitposts BUT just because he got squeezed out, doesn’t mean they want him playing for a rival team.
20	What does it matter we're just going to take another bust in the middle of the first round like always
21	I mean yeah but it still sucks. Hopefully you have better luck in the future.
14	Girls screaming alone gives me horrible flashbacks
27	Oh for sure. Sometimes I wonder if they are actually harming there cause with the over the top hypocrisy the newcomers seem to see it quite quickly.
3	I want to clarify that I am NOT scared. I punched the mirror because it looked at me wrong.
11	My dad wears that sweater every game day! It’s in much worse condition however
10	Nope! His real name starts with a G. Weird spelling of a common name, and pretty identifiable so I’ve never wanted to use it 🙃
27	Ahhh, I see it now. Thanks.
20	let me emphasize that word *storing* not eating out of
13	Oh wow. Gotta visit it one day.
2	"I can hear [NAME] now: ""Why don't I have a mic why don't I have a mic FUCK I need a mic"""
20	And yet you had to walk back your support of this bill when you found out it would catch up your shotgun
20	It depends on if she can download discord and I was planning on emailing her when she gets it
1	That's the worst feeling haha
20	And AI will somehow be magically more disruptive than the industrial revolution. Because... reasons.
25	"I'm sorry but ""Amish heifer"" took me OUT. "
20	I missed [NAME] rabbit foot and the wind chime. Also like half of the ones in episdoe 2.
27	I'm surprised no one posted a Meat thread yet...
17	Don't care. Have fun. Got better things to do.
3	Please feel free to laugh at me if I am wrong but I have seen this movie before...this game is over.
20	You only had to look on the side bar for those and many more.
20	But why....specifically?
16	It would be a crime to not invite him.
1	Really? I thought this joke was a bit plane
17	I like how the last picture is of [NAME] beaming smile and not even so much about the tattoo at all.
20	There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.
20	"...starts Jan 1. ""Published Jan 2"" Way to hit that breaking news."
3	Then leave him. You're not married and sexually comparability is a huge part of making a relationship work. Don't underestimate this my friend.
7	Not enough power, need at least 85 power, preferably 90+ to compete in 18
15	Yeah, I see you’re point. Thank you
21	Hope [NAME] is ok to play but if he needs to rest that hand then that's what he should do...
20	"I kinda expected [NAME] to be like""Oh he's good? Ok bye"""
20	And I call them alcoholics who can't hold a relationship together
4	Nah I think you're just feeling confident because you got a slamming deal on those clothes! I would feel the same way!
9	I'm terrible sorry, /u/bookluvr83, but I'm afraid I must join up with the giving-you-crap-for-not-liking-brownies bandwagon. ^kidding ^^^kinda
1	3:08am and my laughter has now turned into wheezing sobs
0	I don't know what would have happened had you tried to get past, but I'm glad you just noped the duck out of there.
23	Try taking the fillings of your sandwiches to the edges and maybe your kids would stop leaving the edges.
20	You are just tricking yourself.
9	Downvoted because I stated facts ok...
4	Actually good point, I should have asked for the source their too. It was only a rumor when I first heard. Might be wrong, sorry.
20	What a sad end for this franchise. I doubt Fallout 5 will redeem it at this point... what a damn shame
20	Tool fan from the U.S. here. Something seems off about this question. Cheers, mate!
15	None of the [NAME] said please or thank you to the waitress
4	Looks like Plastique stans will be our cringey stans of the season.
5	That blows. Glad you're doing better.
20	More [NAME] leaving the knicks in a scumbag way (yes im salty about something that happened before i was born)
0	They’re as good as tagged
20	[NAME] has no touch..That is why [NAME] kept dropping the ball..
5	Calm down. It's a real concept.
6	Is that why I didn't like the show? Am I too happy?
10	it's basically summer here right now. these posts are clueless.
20	They were talking about what they should call the 'not Constantinople' release in the meeting- its a crime that nobody thought of this.
20	You got this! One day at a time.
15	I’ll give this a look. Thanks for consideration.
20	They won't go after her, they LOVE [NAME]. 
20	Lmaoo the comment posted 14 hours ago gets doenvoted, but the same exact comment posted one hour ago gets upvoted. What??
20	That Facebook post was too loud.
5	At least you can skip it
2	You're not my real mom. I don't have to listen to you. Just because my dad loves you doesn't mean that I have to!
20	[NAME] is playing good
3	Replace smug with thug and you'll see how racist you are
7	Wanna trade lives? I'd gladly take normal height with hair and have the same experience.
20	yeah while i cant even leave the house without being an anxious mess, let alone interact with anyone... 
7	I live in Northern Ontario too, but damn that sounds rough. Where were you from?
0	I just saw it on there... pretty cheap to be such a old item... starting bid on one was a $1
20	Looks eerily like the series of a guy who was unpacked on the street near Star Seeds last night.
11	Solid argument. Honestly this game’s a mess and impossible to balance for both sides equally.
10	Let's not pretend that all fetishes are fine.
14	[NAME] that is frightening...
20	It’s probably warmer in the freezer than it is outside. Oof
20	As I mentioned above I don't have the funds for that right now but as soon as I do I'll definitely be doing that
3	This must be what you get angry about when you don’t have any actual problems in your life.
10	"Saying ""no"" five-ten times then a reluctant ""yes"" to shut you up is not consent!"
20	Oh heck owo
4	I agree with your statement.
18	My favorite pairing now is [NAME] and [NAME]. There's nothing else good. Of course I Like [NAME] and [NAME] too but I miss [NAME] so much
20	She should have her medical license revoked because she took an oath to do no harm
20	Oh same here. Too relatable. Makes me wonder what 50 year old me will miss about the body I've got now.
23	Ah. I thought you meant ads in general. Sorry, bud! 
1	Wow. A relevant and amusing Garfield comic.
20	Also linked with [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] is virtually done.
4	[NAME] will remember that.
23	I left her off because I tried to keep the list to people who were in a little earlier than her.
20	Not all. [NAME] is cool. If he ever runs again in the primaries he will get my vote.
0	You are an awesome person
20	inertial frame of reference is the viewing party.
2	(Stupid) * (how many times you think you can pull it off without getting caught )
20	Soundboard operator needs to start blasting duck quacks whenever we block their guys
6	So... For me it changed earlier yesterday... Maybe it's a location/language thing
3	"> I'm clearly not even a student I guess you've never heard of ""you"" being used as a general address."
1	Sounds like you’re all very young and she’s just enjoying herself flirting with some friends.
9	1 is spot on. Anxiety completely disappears. I like when that happens. One less issue
15	Big thanks to OP for that magnificent wall. I guess that we can reopen the government now.
0	Why pay so much character and it feels so good. In the humble of 1996, the website was a skinny stoner with long hair.
4	Been closeted for 25 years, I feel like it made me the man I am today. 
5	Thank you so much. I am sorry for what happened to you.
6	What...the...actual...**** 😂 are you high?
20	dude different folks different strokes. don’t kill my buzz bro. happy new years!!!
20	Mexico didn't start the war. Thats probably where you are confused. The US invaded Mexico in both occasions, Mexico only defended itself in both occasions.
14	You’re being bullied. Leave.
4	Wow yes, that is a perfect way to describe it.
20	i think people are just getting more and more fed up with playing against him
23	I know, which is why I said it hasn't been referenced by any *living* characters on the show.
20	What's wrong with that? [NAME] scandal is funny but not something to focus on in 2020.
20	You're clearly reporting all of my comments, and then acting like you don't know why they could get deleted haha, that's hilarious.
15	Yankees, Nets, and Giants, all the best!
1	Are you actually serious? I'm really interested in the details lol
20	This is turtle thing
17	OH MY GOD! The PTA has disbanded! Ahh! Ahh! AHHHHH •jumps through window•
23	Nihilism makes me happy, but I know that’s just my opinion.
0	Tu eres very nice man
17	This should in r/funny not here, very expected
20	Ironic, since cleaning your room is what [NAME] is always on about.
23	If my mom were still alive, she'd be so pissed at [NAME] being in this cast.
4	Consider yourself lucky haha. I used to call my local radio station daily to request they play it ‍♀️
20	Oh sure, that makes it much easier to pay your bills with no money. The money will just come at some point in the future! 
4	Downside of city based police. State level policing is where it's at. Problem on the Gold Coast? Send police from Brisbane.
20	Skeptical approach, always lol
10	The question wasn’t phrased well, but she does look different than her normal self in this screencap
0	I appreciate you taking the time to at least justify your reasoning but I still very much disagree.
20	Thanks for further justifying my support for Tulsi, Daily Gross.

1	🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m sorry for your misfortune but it’s still funny too.
13	You’re in Iceland, a particularly craggy rock would be pretty interesting to you.

9	Yet, his recoveries on attacks are abysmal.
10	Self driving cars still won't help fix the problem if old people can't afford them
24	#I am relaxed
3	lmao ok buddy good luck with those demonstrably false statements in future

2	How dare you assume my mortality! >:O
13	YAAAS! Even though you're a stranger on the internet, this has made my day.
21	brah the usps loses a few billions each and every fiscal quarter. they are totally insolvent and entirely dep3end on tax payer money.

17	Haha, then i am in... :)
3	Fucking hate [NAME]..
20	You should hit up [NAME], he can help.
21	The fourth person could be [NAME]. But looking at the trailer it’s probably [NAME] who is back because of [NAME] tumour. Sigh.
23	If I don't shave I won't be able to wear a bikini, so not shaving is not an option
9	Watching LEC is such a snooze fest... the casters are awful, the interviewer has awful flow, the players have no personality...
23	I basically had no negative side effects. I did switch to IUD because I hated remembering to take a pill everyday. But no issues.
20	Whatever it is, not enough.
20	I’m actually not! From USA, sadly. 🙃 Edited to add: unless you didn’t mean me, then I apologize!

27	Awh you're hurt
1	Your name needs some work LOL

20	I found it interesting that [NAME] wasn’t addressed in FA or until the later rounds of the draft.
7	what’s your favorite music video?
4	No problem mate. If you're looking for activities, give these boys a look: 
0	ye but that is fucking [NAME]... there is a diffrence between [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] is good but he is no [NAME] ;)
14	“Got caught talking about meditation” Sounds terrible I am so sorry you had to go through that kind of thought policing.
4	The current situation is one of cronyism, it doesn't represent a few market, which has other tools to deal with such things.
20	we roll tonight to the guitar bite. and for those about to rock, I salute you 
4	Yes officer, this one here
14	is this sub scared to talk about [NAME] getting arrested
7	And who would you vote for, exactly
7	Why did [RELIGION] take inspiration from stoicism and neoplatonism and aristotelianism if outside sources are verboten?
9	His head bounced on the hardwood. Damn.

20	I hurt you now.

13	Wowowowow!!!! I’ve been campaigning for [NAME] too!
4	It’s true. Icebergs can’t melt steel beams.

2	Sounds hella aggressive. You can say the same thing while being nicer about it.
3	The fuck?! You're in the wrong subreddit with this regressive bullshit victim blaming.

5	It's fucking incredible how many people would like you if you would just make eye contact and smile at them. Fucking incredible
16	The anniversary march was held in Derry Sunday past , not one mention on BBC itv not a thing. 14 people murdered in cold blood. Nothing.
4	You are an absolute gem

23	I mean, its not like they gonna ban the Donald for a while 
15	Thanks for sharing! I've got some smoothie recipes to start me out and the one I bought today at a local shop seemed to help a bit.

1	Haha wait why does this sounds so familiar

3	The article was about LEGAL delivery, you big dummy. I too love when people without knowledge of a situation respond like they know what’s what.
20	People have gotten triggered on this sub the past month if you didn't call [NAME] a [NAME], so I think we can handle it.
19	I've never been so bored with so much money on the line. I am numb now.
12	I get abused on the daily fam ‍♀️‍♂️‍♂️‍
7	Alleviate' meaning what? Make my working life suck less?
20	It kinda is. It's better that special needs kids aren't hidden and their families don't feel that it is necessary or required.
1	I never said it should have been called. I just think it's hilarious that the replay literally shows it.
0	Great, so we know the spanish pronounciation is therefore racist and now I'm offended by it.
20	Leave chicken in a vat of blue dye overnight and you'll lose all the pink
14	I understand that there are issues. However, if someone chose to stay away from Perth due to the violent behaviour then where would they go on holiday?
10	I can't post on r/dankmemes :(

20	MRW I'm just trying to make it through my day and someone brings up Brexit or [NAME]

20	Yea can get a pic of me and my mates when we go out for drinks next So don't bother trying with jokes? Just keep it empty?

17	funny
9	oh my [NAME]

21	Yea, I'm willing to bet the auto makers have known about this technology for quite a while.

10	Nice try. That doesn’t work though.
4	Thanks man. You too
3	Fuuuuck that's rough
17	This one is hitting people that knew him hard. He was such a happy guy all the time. Hopefully they catch the bastard soon.
17	Good to know my paranoia has paid off haha, and same, sooo many snacks.
20	True, but it all started under [NAME] and will get even worse if Labour manages to get into government. 
15	[NAME] is for real. This is gonna be his league in a few years imo. Great pick.
20	eggs last forever
4	I would agree. That doesn’t really address the conservative versus alt-right labeling issue though.
0	I’m reading Homegoing by [NAME] and it’s so good! It reminds me of Pachinko, which I also loved. 
14	This makes me want to get nipple piercings but I’m too scared to :/

20	"Siri ""calling mom would be sad"""

3	Every Saturday for the foreseeable future will be spent studying for the LSAT. Fuck
13	They both do! Like wow!!!
20	Definitely leave him. However, you don’t owe him anything, let alone a letter. It’s better to leave him wondering. 
5	So happy for you! Keep dancing, dancing is freedom!! Something we feel we will never have again. 
4	You can still joke but people will react negatively and will cause consequences
1	LOL no its not all in the video. We have all seen the longform video now so its obvious that I was right.
20	Reminds me of this stunt [NAME] pulled a few years ago in
0	Great! I hope we can make our loan system work better
6	Don’t you guys want to get off with me?
0	Your amazing too!
4	I would have to imagine this girl has just been training super hard for the past few weeks.
1	I can see that. Ffs who the hell would expect a Dean to recognize 2 people out of 25,000 people lol.
10	Let's be honest here if [NAME] played last night the Canucks win. This defense is a major concern and needs a complete overhaul this offseason.
25	sorry. emotional writing bot! you dont know what its like to have an amygdala! lol
6	[NAME] royally fucked up that last rotation. Also did [NAME] even get a single kill with their specialists ?
11	You didn't come here to debate. You came here to excuse abhorrent behavior.
2	Kill whitey!
8	I am so sorry for your loss and all the stress you have right now. All the internet hugs you want right now! <3
20	Uhh have they really concreted those phone boxes shut?
3	Only [NAME] could claim that shutting down the thing he is in charge of is a success.
13	Here, here. Cheers to starting fresh!
4	Glad you answered your own question.
20	When are the Blackhawks going to play again games that matter? :(
20	It seems hazy, and there’s been conflicting messages
4	I agree. She's a terrible model. I tried to get on board with her, but all her editorials in Vogue were so flat. 
0	This is the sweetest thing ever, im gonna steal it and use it on my fiance
6	Why was the discrimination and ghettoization of [NAME] prior to their extermination legal? Because legislators sometimes don't care for morality.
3	I might be stupid but I thought [NAME] wore #16?
20	She doesn’t have to be added to the game for her to be significant, [NAME] was just an extreme example.
20	Whats up with the human race turning into invertebrates anyways?
5	Maybe one day you'll open yours and realise feminism helps everyone

4	It's definitely alive. Not sure it's doing quite so well...for 99% of people anyway.
20	PAC man looks too fast
20	That whole chart looks like something someone made up to post on incels.
0	Congratulations! Idk how long you've been living here, but welcome to Colorado!! :D I hope you're enjoying it!
20	"Ahhh, the old ""if you don't vote the way I do, you're a big dumb idiot"" gambit. "
20	#[NAME] camp is dying, price must be dropping now that NYY are out
9	I dunno how to read this yet. I guess it depends on how the other moves they make shake out.
14	It is 100% a scam. They've been copying many [NAME] with the same message.
21	Just imagine the waitstaff carrying cast-iron plates everywhere! oof!
24	So glad you left and didn’t just sit through the date with that idiot!
24	OOF, well if im dancing with someone i dont really look at their crotch so im pretty surd ur fine. How old are u
0	Thanks. Those are great suggestions.
20	[NAME] being 50-33 against winning teams kinda suggests it wouldn't matter that much if their division were better. Maybe have gone to 7 superbowls instead of 8.
12	I’m embarrassed how long it took for me to figure this out. 🤦🏼‍♀️
3	Aw poor kid. At least he has a bomb-ass name. Too bad he probably doesn't remember it anymore.
15	We welcome her with open arms.
2	Let this be a lesson at how easily manipulated some therapist are. Block the therapist immediately. He/she has been compromised by a psychopath.
27	I didn't know there was a name for that.
0	Most watched sport in the world lol
20	Then they are idiots.
10	> i have never even dated a girl. Lol
15	I once went alert on N1 and killed 3 people.. 2 maf and a doc. Doc got resurrected later thankfully
6	So the key to living is to do nothing?
4	Oh that also would have been good. Plus, breaking pottery is so satisfying
21	The only winner here is this guys future divorce lawyer.
17	I like this template, it makes me happy.
20	But they aren't blaming anyone other than the potential law breaking of other fisherman here. It's a straw man.
20	Looks like the next level of a horror character
15	Congrats! How long was the journey? Did you stick with [NAME] the entire time?
17	This. Nothing would make me happier than the see the gNats hamstrung for the next decade because they gave a ridiculous contract to a hometown hero.
20	They blew him? That's a hell of a deleted scene....
0	I thought you were just going to wait her out. You actually engineered her loss of space to someone else. WELL DONE!!!!
3	They’re probably fighting, that’s why she’s *really* getting out of the house for “self care.”
15	That's along the lines of what I was thinking, thank you!
0	Shits me no end mate, good on you for doing something
1	Sonofabitch that makes it so much better [NAME] Edit: you talking about this?
26	[NAME] thats real? I'm so glad i unsubbed from pics
6	Why would they stop there with like 15 feet of visibility? It clearly isn’t just the truck drivers fault
20	[NAME] has 6 eyes and will thus be the best actor in the movie
0	Free with a price of $600+ if you want full standard collection or maybe $300+ if you grind with no life. What a deal!
7	Im very interested. Contact me if you are going to set one up and want/need help.
21	>Shes completely self-made too :) Now I'm imagining her as some sort of entity that brings its own existence about
20	"""At least you're not this guy."""
14	No, that’s just another way of backing a coup. Sit back and wait. If either side is going too far then offer to help.
7	How often does this happen? To you and others? I'm curious.
24	Could be an attainability thing. My personality is very aloof and I tend to have much better results with more confident girls in general.
4	"[Licks salt] ""Hey guys, this *definitely* isn't snow!"""
20	Why would [NAME] retire when he still has 5 horcruxes left?
27	A surprise, but a welcome one
18	i love you.
0	MAKE A MORE DETAILED STORY OF THAT. ALSO MAKE UR OWN SUBREDDIT (r/amusementparkshenanigans). UR A GOOD STORYTELLER
6	When the gov shut down under [NAME] many were calling for his resignation. This is similar, but people already hate [NAME] so obviously people are more angry.
1	If you find it I'm definitely sending it to my sibling. There's a special love for the weird in my family
20	Belive in yourself
0	[NAME] looks so much better than she did at the premiere. Her lashes aren’t fucked up and the high pony is great.

4	Exactly! I'm Pan cos I like warm colors babey!!
20	I had no idea someone could actually be this stupid. > capitalism.
15	Ofcourse. If you can debunk our arguments and stuff,, well you win. Have a nice day too
1	[NAME] I LOVE YOU
4	We should have had a dman protecting the net on that play. Our future is Taco's
11	And yet, it’s bad to manipulate people. Which is what the in laws are doing. 
4	Also a lot of houses in the US might not have too many neighbours. It’s a lot more sparse out there
15	Sorry this shit is happening to you. Thanks for capturing the first [NAME] in WWII. Go Coast Guard.
20	No matter how hard you scrub it WON'T COME OUT.
13	I legit did this last night, I hit it and wave it around like crazy
17	I fucking love New Years day with the Hawks playing in the Winter Classic
1	I’m sure someone in the lions thread already posted something similar. They love shitposts haha.
23	I TOO AM HUMAN AND I SENSE A JOKE HA YES I AGREE WITH YOIR LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION.
17	I once got flowers from a girl... idk why but it just feels good
20	Just let [NAME] run it as a FB
15	Thank you for the great recommendation. I'll get on that as soon as I can, and keep you updated.
14	I want to go scuba diving so bad, but swimming in anything bigger than a pool terrifies me.
4	I don't think the blame rests entirely with America (those woh joined the taliban still made a concerete choice) but no US forces are not innocent.
3	Yep, they expect you to revolve around them, but think they’re exempt from returning the favour. 
0	This is awesome! I really wish I could make it!
5	bro if you can't hold your pee for 30 min, you should go see a doctor

10	Yep that’s the problem I have. Can’t make friends
3	I only meant it in kindness, I’ve loved this country so far. You’re all so damned friendly here
14	[NAME] is scared out there. Didnt want the ball
20	I will have nothing to do with this specter, who selectively appears to individuals and abandons others. No better than a cruel warlord.
17	This made my rainy day
20	She looks like her face is pulled back with ''face lifts'' tape. Or like she's pulling back her face like that scene in MIB I.
17	Happy Cake day.
2	It's good to see that the rich are being cured of this. :) As for the poor, we can just burn them for fuel.
20	Coincidence vs correlation vs causation
4	The same thing used to happen with Cowboy. We've been that team before.
20	Let's say for a moment that this was true. How does that get us the truth more often, and more reliably, than science?
19	Looks like any time there’s a huge spike in viewers, it’s a crossover. Legends sure has a really pathetic turn out. 
2	FUCK YOU CHAD, WE ARE COOL GAMERS RISE UP😎😎😎💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥👅 BOTTOM TEXT

15	I thought it was but didn't find anything in Reddit's horrible search. Thank you and I apologize for this.
20	MI-13 was uncontested by the GOP, too, but the numbers probably work out because Tlaib beat the Green Party candidate 81-19.
17	I’m so glad someone linked it. You’re doing the important work. 🤣
20	It's a better option because it's my life and none of your business? Lmfao, who are you

20	I find it unfortunate that you use gender-non-conformance as an insult.
11	That looks absolutely awful. On the good side, whoever made it, can only get better.
4	I would start laughing, screaming seems inappropriate

20	I'm not rotting, I'm drinking.

20	I hope it was somebody else's.
26	You’re trash april. I’m November 2000 actually. Damn we’re old.

7	Can I see it?
20	Yet, the Blue Bell crowd still worships this half ass ice cream, full of artificial flavors and HFCS.
20	It's bizarre that it's considered normal to intentionally brainwash people into murdering psychos.
20	Maybe one is bigger than the other, so getting more t-time?

10	The joke doesn't even have anything to do with the song.

20	oops, back in a minute, your round!
15	PS4 but thank you anyway
20	You can get into big, fuck up your life forever trouble.
5	Always buy merch if you like it. It won’t be there the next time you go to get it.
4	Denigrating your opponents as either racist xenophobes or labelling them too stupid to understand the issue at hand will have that effect.
23	I perform nostril waxing. It is surprising hardly painful at all. Feels so much better too!
26	I'm all for not getting too crazy because we've had a rough stretch, but [NAME] scoring twice hurt. A lot.
3	It's extremely rude.

0	Excellent collage, I learned so much from all these guys. The community is great, the unconfiscatable conference was awesome 🙏🏽🙏🏽

20	Yeah lets hope so, i hear the IRA is very forgiving of rich folk.

4	Obviously a flying monkey somewhere. What a nightmare that guy is. I'm glad you cut him out of your life.

25	Sorry pal but your just England’s b team

2	No youre a cunt

0	You nailed the crazy eyes. She scary.
11	Yah, totally. It's just kind of scary when all you hear are loud extremes on both sides. 
15	Thanks for confirming ☺!
20	It's so difficult keeping track on who is friendly with who in the Middle East. How are Iraq:s relations with Turkey and their own Kurdistan nowadays?
13	Seriously doubt it will be Knights of Ren, but that would certainly be a great way to get people excited and build hype.
20	> Nothing mentioned about him thinking to transfer. That's what this whole thread is about, dork.
3	And I said, 'wouldn't that have _prevented_ you from having the name [NAME]?', and he said *FUCK*
20	What real things pop out of existence because you stopped looking at them?
16	Look I'm not saying I don't understand your sentiment but we really ought to save this one for people openly advocating for genocide.
0	Tory nationalists puts nationalstic soundbite. TBH, at this stage, an endorsement from TM should be seen as implicit admission that independence is a great idea.
4	Totally agree. I'm actually excited to play overwatch again tonight because of it. Teamwork is everything.
20	Turn off your phone, computer or even the internet. It is scary to do but just for now when the urges hits.
3	You're asking for scientific proof of spirituality. You're either very dumb, trolling, or you think I'm a charlatan.
20	you didn't win fast enough and it's already mana 10? guess who deserved that bolt right in his face
23	ok i noticed the eyelashes but the rest is really unnoticable
9	Ignorance is bliss
4	Protesting in general is an emotional response. People’s attachment to their cause grows stronger in the face of confrontation and adversity.
20	Refusing to acknowledge the *'First Act of Supremacy (1534)'* was a reason too.
6	I don’t think you understand the meaning of cute
4	My mom thinks this neighborhood is safe, and I kinda don't want her being more paranoid but I feel like I should do SOMETHING.

4	I review you - *clap clap* - [NAME], bye bitch, gone
20	###[NAME] NOT ONLY IS THIS A REPOST OF ONE TOP r/jokes POST...ITS A COMBINATION OF TWO!
20	Oh [NAME] if I was 9 and my parents did that I would cringe real hard

9	Getting tougher to make those mortgage **and** car payments.

15	Thanks! It is too bad we can't suddenly age [NAME] and [NAME] a year or so.
4	Oh it's a well known phenomenon, unsure exactly what it is but I think it's a bit of princess syndrome with mental posho co morbidity. 
3	I think you also underestimate how big Chelsea has become, especially in the States
20	Y'all i have option one. Lemme tell you. Sex is important. I miss it
20	Iirc it’s definitely darker than [NAME], but here it’s almost the same color.
21	I'M MOTIVATED!
10	Not a point I’m trying to make. 👍
2	Fuck the cubs
4	We did it [NAME], we stopped racism
20	"You know it doesn't use the word ""boycott"" at all, right?"
20	I miss candlestick :(
4	She actually does that, because she sees that you are happy, but the person behind you really needed that :P
1	Anything is a dildo of you're brave enough
0	No no no, the ball was tipped. He’s a great kicker
6	I think I know why [NAME] put you on this earth. Go on now you have a job to do.

0	Fam, I fucking love [NAME] play. Gotta be the most exciting dude in the league other than [NAME] when he’s hitting everything from 30ft+
2	US labor laws are fucked up
20	I’m proud of you. First few days are among the toughest.
20	Lmao r/starwarsleaks and r/starwarsspeculation in a nutshell
20	I imagine it would be helpful for little kids who cant reach the faucet.
20	I thought they left that address and moved to Henderson.
5	The best answer is simply don’t do it. Having said that, good luck my friend. 
20	Son of a bitch... here we go. Can't just stand there guys....
9	Everyone who is complicit in all this should be punished and questioned as to why they allowed this to happen. Complete disgrace!
20	Anything yet?
18	Love this!!!
3	The most hatful crowd is not the lefties. Lefties may be annoying but hate as such is a tool used by the right much more skillfully and forcefully.
20	ok i noticed the eyelashes but the rest is really unnoticable
9	In that conversation it was the girl being boring and closed... sometimes it’s not your fault and people feel they’re the ones being awkward
2	They claim religious persecution and no lawmaker would want to deal with that can of worms.
13	So so good
11	Do your worst. The tag just describes your views. Could have been much more vicious.
24	You look like [NAME] fucked [NAME]
20	It's rare to see a wholesome post here. Nice to see them nonetheless.

21	Attempt to con the senate. This should continue to be entertaining
7	That. Is flipping Cute. He's definately a dog person.
10	No, that isn't possible. Discord hosts the call, which means any attempt at using wireshark would just show Discord's information, not yours.
20	Glad that [NAME] continues to be himself even in a mystery fortress. I doubt I'll ever play another game as good.
20	I don’t know why, but if I had to guess his sport beforehand...I’d still say it’d be bowling
7	I think this would be common amongst musicians. I wonder if it's related to this discovery regarding muscle memory or if it's something else?
0	I’m proud of you. First few days are among the toughest.
4	I thought that too, but I was wrong. And I know that full health is 170.
20	Mad at [NAME] for what she consensually agreed to
20	I would vote no to a United Ireland because the Republic doesn't have a free health service and no free prescriptions
0	I think Judge came in a little too late so he’ll need to be amazing for the next 8 years
15	Oh yeah, thanks, sorry for the confusion, good thing someone called their bullshit :)

14	My only issue is he keeps blowing draft picks on QB’s that are terrible.
8	I wish this was animated.
3	Those are separate issues from the sample size.
4	We also turned the ball over about a million and 3 times. I'm over it honestly
3	r/uk hates nationalism but likes the SNP. Not sure if hypocrisy or it’s different people
4	Sounds like an fp to me 🤔
20	"I'm guessing ""Corporate Stooge"" didn't focus group well."
9	Letting it go is the big struggle. For me at least.
7	Former HUD secretary? I'll bet he'd make a hell of a brain surgeon.
20	And more [NAME].
2	[NAME] damn it I hate when enemy keepers use their hands and stuff to keep the ball outside their goal. Make a mistake pls.
17	I am so glad they didn't have this attendance in my day, skipping class would be impossible.
23	I realize. I was too hasty in my conclusions.
4	[NAME], I’d like to buy a letter A...
11	Yeah it’s not like I want my cat to lick me in a sexual way that’s just weird.
20	Bet you $20 she had more in her than 0.05 hell, more than 0.08 hmm...
27	Oooo too soon man
20	To be completely fair, before the break-up (in the books), [NAME] wanted to marry her. [NAME] told him to stfu. 
10	Yeah , yeah you can’t change my mind , you’ll get there eventually .
7	But what about teams like the cavs? They are clearly a terrible terrible team, but they gotta wait longer to rebuild with a 3 year average.
20	>Tua gave him a look, like, keep going ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
6	Swear i have seen this before? had it been reposted?

20	that's why r/theredpill is such a thing. you arnt the first. you're showing a few nice guy warming signs bud.
14	I'm 25 and I still don't have a license. I'm terrified of driving and get anxiety every time I'm behind the wheel.
20	Just don’t be born on a raped planet. Jeez why do you damned virgeens make such a fuss?
20	"BFV have anticheat... Why do you claim ""complete lack of an anti-cheat"" ? They are running fairfight + some inhouse shit afaik..."

4	Clearly there is only one way to solve this dilemma; COMMUNISM!
3	Can't even put on dress pants now without turning back and checking for my parents.
20	Yeah, and there's no better way to make a market more competitive than to regulate it more...
20	To be honest I miss the deep bomb on 3rd and 2. Watching the Browns game reminded me how I always love when it worked.
20	What do you mean?
20	Is that not common in your area? I see amish people all the time
6	[NAME]... why you do this?
10	So do I. But you can't just blame it all on the dude.
1	Haha .. In pakistan 47 is the normal temp during summer... Lol noob.. Gg ez
20	Yeah man, did the trick for me. 
1	Lol at the caption, but I believe it’s Netflix’s new original movie Close.
2	It could have been worse! All the chairs and table are still upright.
4	That's what I say, but the commercial is clearly pandering.
7	OMG are you serious? Do you know what episode? That's horrendous! I'm really disappointed in [NAME] on that one.
3	> This sub looks like a rabid left-wing dumpster fire. It was bad before the election and then got far worse.
2	Tell your husband. Its lies by omissions. Who are you to pick and choose what HE wants to know.
27	I was shocked. They were talking earlier on the news about her losing by less than 100 being a victory, of sorts.
20	How has nobody in the coaching staff tried to stop [NAME] from going in and killing us
20	Don’t forget sports gambling. THEN we’ll be happy.
20	>Star centre [NAME] in the leadership group Oh my
27	Exactly! It amazes me how many people dont communicate with each other. Talk about it, see what they say. Discuss. Come to a conclusion.
5	Be free!!
13	It's interesting but would be super impractical as a prosthetic for an amputee or someone with a limb deformity.
20	There is no greater form of oppression than being called a bigot. #debateme #babyhitler #otherpeoplesbabies
7	You should stop visiting it then no?
18	I love the Justice Democrats so much
15	I am too but thank you for having it and I will try to think more about the points you raised.
11	> to my knowledge she is straight Don’t say you have a chrush on her it will only make your relationship between each other weird.
20	Under rated reference.
14	Just imagine Disney characters without gloves. Yes it's that horrifying
8	I love this! Wish I lived in the city!
2	Who cares? 2019 season hasn’t even started
3	I think they think that they have created the best cod ever and everyone who doesn't think that is wrong

2	Ass is ass!
0	I'm not sure the game is balanced with always having access to healing or bouncing from lane. Much harder to wear down a hero.
2	[NAME] is the most useless phantom thief change my mind
20	She's on quite the journey of discovery about herself atm. Excellent meme-terial.
8	This makes me want Lancaster to be cannon! It’ll probably never happen though😥.

20	Halakhically it appears that they didn't have a problem with it. Halakhically I have a problem with it.

20	Dang.. I’m none of them. :-(
3	Damn I WANT to hear this!!!
9	Six shots on goal for [NAME] and still nothing. This breaks my heart.
0	Those are the [NAME], they sing backup for [NAME]. They’re awesome!
3	I would go into the walk-in and curse like a sailor for a minute at full volume then freeze out the offender to the best of my ability.

10	Not sure, can't really feel anything from any other memory that had strong emotional ties 
20	Yesterday. All my troubles seemed so faaar away. Now it looks though that they're here to stay. Oh I believe, in yesterday. 
1	Kinda sad if that's what you got out of the ad lol

20	They’re led by...gasp... a WOMAN!
18	I like you
20	she has a lot of lore, read the comics. and yes she's the best designed character from MKX along with [NAME] and maybe kotal
20	Interesting the dream ends there because [NAME] killed Imam [NAME]. [NAME] is not a companion of the Prophet.
20	Well first, im against government period, and second im conveying this under a layer of satire to make the ideas spread more easily
4	[NAME] gonna end up killing her. Its just whether she does it willingly, regrettably or accidentally.
3	"At least he was polite - ""please"" fuck off! "
0	The intro in that video looks like a sand storm on there, imagine a sand storm while playing GA on that map, it would be awesome!

0	I think it is worth documenting this sort of stuff, as a reminder. They'd do this to your kids too. In a heartbeat.
21	Because he only won it begrudgingly last year. No one likes watching him play. [NAME] will win it unless [NAME] scores 40+ points like every game.
20	Honestly, I wouldn’t want to poop without my phone either. Gotta scroll reddit while I’m poopin!
26	Sadly, it was not
12	209 comments and we don’t get to read any? All that good pasta advice going to waste. Shame.

20	Now this is a Contrapoints video I want to see
1	Rofl this pysyk kid is a disgrace
20	It means France. [NAME] is a guy from Paris.

10	My ETL been trying to tell us every box should take us 30 seconds max, and everyone ive asked about that has laughed and called it bullshit
20	I'd say it's at least a little ironic given that Artifact is modeled closely on the pricing model of MtG's cardboard edition.
20	[NAME] save us
1	Similarly to how they all claim to never read it but they're always reacting to what's said in the comments lol
24	Woof thank goddddd I changed my flair

7	Is that for hazmat? And thanks bro👊
0	my favourite depictions of [NAME] and the gang are the ones where [NAME] is stoic and sassy and [NAME] and [NAME] are super emotional goofballs
26	True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams.
20	FYI not all skinheads are racists. [NAME] suck and should be confronted.
4	No worries! 😊
3	I didn't say remain was left wing. I said the E.U acts as a buffer against the most insane and cruel Tory policies.
3	My feelings exactly. First thought, a sarcastic 'Thanks.'
13	"Needs another ""hockey feels hard at the moment"" and a game against Dallas after that."
18	I'd love that

20	Feb ‘06 [NAME] But your point stands
4	A little weird but I guess it's wholesome.

7	When did we get rid of uprights? He was amazing for us?
15	Different color for different people, please and thank you.
3	Bishop [NAME] was talking about lawmakers rather than the women who seek abortions. Though the situation doesn't matter when it comes to dismembering a baby.
20	Im also a young adult, >18 <25 if that helps
25	I apologize for doubting you.
0	[NAME] is letting [NAME] play 3 :0. That is good news.
0	Honestly, I love hearing about stories like this - like the multitude of Skyrim and Oblivion mod developers who eventually got hired by studios due to their work.
3	[NAME], beer me the strength to make this price lower!
0	That’s actually a great idea. I didn’t even think of that.
3	One of my coworkers at my old job used to get a venti hot white mocha with 20 packets of sugar stirred in😷
5	Good for you.
20	There was a commercial about men encouraging other men not to perpetuate toxic masculinity. Of course the Republicans felt it was condescending and anti-men.
18	Yes. It feels sharp and hurts in the chest sometimes. It will pass, but it freaking sucks. I'm here to listen, if you want❤
20	Dont keep your mouth shut.
3	That doesn't sound right but I don't know enough about stars to dispute it
13	I don't blame you, this sub makes me feel crazy on a daily basis. 
8	I wish I could go, but I can’t. Do enjoy your time and I pray it is spiritually fruitful for you!
20	That’d what you think.
20	Thought this was about signing brown. Op is an attention whore
0	[NAME] speed!
0	Man, what a great post Edit: wow! Thanks for the kind, gold stranger!
6	Indian/East Asian?
20	Gee...what a guy...
20	Your an idiot and trying to justify your ignorance.
21	Unless you're a conservative trying to protect yourself. In that case, good luck.
19	The Rockets, too. This month will be a horror show.
0	All women are useless - maybe if you made better choices it would be better for ya
0	Try really warm water instead. It's awesome.
4	I'm new here from the U.S. This convo cleared it up for me, so thanks.
9	There’s NO WAY that car is worth 25k - walk away.
11	Whoa this is really creepy
6	Wow sold out during break without most of the students. Don't know how they'll fit the students in once we're back
20	You've shifted the goalposts from first novel to first modern novel... You people always complain that incels don't provide any support for their claims.
20	Removing republicans is the first step. You can scream about how they are the same, but perhaps you should look at voting history. Good luck. 
0	I used to like [NAME] so much him and [NAME] were one of my fave couples but I’m over him and his BS lol
10	It’s probably down to low player base.
18	We still luv u
20	Also there's better ways we can spend taxpayer dollars than on another election.
9	I didnt see a ref's hand up, I was about to have a stroke
5	Say that you like her

0	That's the theme of this excellent play:
6	mayhaps (I do not know what you mean)
0	Props to the guy for being honest
10	this isnt really wholesome? he probably shot any gender of deer and didnt think twice about hunting does
20	This is so true yet they usually dont listen.
4	Exactly. And they parade around with their protruding stomachs as if they're [NAME] gift to the world. *barf*
3	That, plus they also store our info insecurely so it leaks out. Just another part of this dumb economics game I guess...
20	The rest of the starting QBs.
4	it's also impolite to talk on the train
5	As long as you do the cooking by the book 😏
20	It's in the news. I think I read it in SFgate or maybe mercury news.
7	That’s a shame. What’s worse, evangelicalism or Scientology? Tough call
17	Correct. I just enjoy debating them.
7	I like you, do you like me? Please circle Yes No
17	Happy little lies.
27	I was honestly shocked when they denied an overpayment, especially since after the charges cleared it would have been a $0 balance.
7	Wait, what was [NAME] doing?
20	This post is amazing. Definitely starting to see good days and life just kept improving after my Nex. Thank you for this
15	Yeah I had android and was having difficulties but I was able to get it easily when using my gf's mac. Thanks!
20	This kinda looks like something shot in the style of Reno 911. Especially the bit where the cops look back and simultaneously say “Jaywalking!”
2	You're a freak, you dirty dog you.
20	Probably one everytime I run out of the $1 million, 97% success rate? Worth the risk 
10	YOUR momentum doesn't help you, its the direction you're aiming and THEIR momentum that does. they were probably backing up when that happened.
9	I did too. A shame, because it looks to be a good movie otherwise.
26	I lost a six pack this way once. For a good year every traffic stop became a field sobriety test.
20	Just put it on your penis soft and then you will grow into it
19	Get her professional help.
14	This is a terrible idea
14	*Dread it, run from it* *[NAME] still arrives*
20	WHERE THR HECK IS VOL'JIN AND MY TROLL EMPIRE, YEARS HAVE PASSED WE HAVE 2 PANDA AND STILL ONE TROLL
20	Then keep your hands visible and fight the ticket in court. Don’t understand how this is such a complex issue.
13	That was amazing!
15	I'm just glad I've never heard of this game before otherwise this news would be disappointing.
20	Curious about your thoughts on BC’s LNG activity.
1	Lmao I’m so sorry but yet intrigued as to how it contributed to your breakup?
20	here for me scenes of [NAME] being dragged by her children
20	I think you're probably a shite irl.
21	I'll pass.
14	We had a clown banging on dorm windows, on campus, with a knife in 2016. Was terrifying. 
20	If you enjoyed it, go for it.
18	I can be convinced to like any trade right now but it all comes down to the return.
6	I’m confused because her mom doesn’t post anything bad, especially compared to her photos she took in prison. 
20	They're basically our version of [NAME] and [NAME] at this point. Every video seems to involve a dumbass rant that misses the point of the topic.
4	Wrote some good poems too

20	>would of ......
20	The real joke is your grades dude
20	“I got five on it” for the movie US is decent as well. They made it so creepy.
10	No offense, but you are jumping in conclusions that may be as incorrect as blaming [NAME]. 
20	But the last scene I saw was just [NAME] bringing the kid to her no talk of leaving was there a scene where [NAME] reconciles with [NAME]
4	This is exactly what I’ve been thinking!
9	He didn't see him and afterwards tried to high five him but [NAME] was walking away

3	I’m sorry, you just sound like one of those people who takes overwatch super seriously and has no life
17	Let's hope that they don't miss, huh?
20	No like its legit cgi Edit: this comment has some value the entire thread has things to pick apart in it
12	Super weird question. Not really commenting either way, just so weird the life we have created for modern humans.
20	I know of two people who did the Keto and some intermittent eating and got off all meds.
20	Yes but my point is [NAME] raping [NAME] makes more sense if she gives birth to [NAME] and [NAME], not [NAME].
20	The old bait and switch.
5	Being rich isnt the only way to be successful. The first success to conquer is learning to love and accept ourselves
20	Having said that, if it was me there instead of you I probably wouldn't have come up with that until 20 minutes after the altercation was over.

11	Eyebrow zits are the worst. I'd rather have a lip pimple than an eyebrow pimple. Also part of the fanclub for your eyes.
18	I love this ahahah
4	"""I care about the nation and the world"" and ""I'd rather let trump win than vote democrat"" are opposites of eachother"

0	1. Keep doing exactly what we have been doing for the last 24 years. 2. Expropriate the land. 3. ?? 4. Economic growth.
2	Can't speak for that dude, but I'd say hell yeah they're a hate sub. 
7	Would it make you feel any better, little girl, if they was pushed out of windows?
20	Looking at the thread now, it seems that this comment was also deleted.
18	I love those moments
20	Ahh change.org, where change goes to...do nothing

20	I’m sure losing obj will help [NAME] get out of his slump, or help develop whichever rookie qb they bring in. 
13	Love [NAME]. Amazing beaches!
20	Not my proudest fap
20	I just don't think [NAME] is the guy to do something like this.

13	I’m really excited for this year! Especially the Wu Lin hero , I can’t wait to wield my double-handed jian😍😍
6	So then what do I do? Should I tell priests? Will they kick me out?
12	Except forming an opinion of a topic without even having basic knowledge of said topic makes you sound pretty arrogant and entirely undercuts your opinion.
21	I just hope the show brings [NAME] back because she was really great.
26	True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams.
20	Most parents do that to make their kids take vitamins and eat vegetables. Who cares?
0	Such grace.
5	Or you could y'know just be a nice person and respect other people's opinions and likes? ^Since ^you ^clearly ^have ^plenty ^of ^your ^own

19	I know he will be, I'm just nervous. His face is just going to be so sad 😢
2	I think this title is biased. It groups all media improperly.
8	I would never do such a thing. :P
20	Yeah but she didn’t get anybody to vote for anyone. She said they all said they were voting for [NAME] anyway.
4	She went on a PR tour in Syria and met with him. I think it’s fair to say she’s pro-Assad.
0	Would be nice.
0	[NAME] is gorgeous and so are you.
3	Our problems are our own. Racism, classism, mysogyny, bigotry. 
6	And you believe this?
10	It's irrelevant though. it doesn't need to be specified in the title of a post.
20	Blind kid throes better first pitch than [NAME]

20	That’s fair.
5	You have to sneak up on the flame by approaching slowly.
4	Its nice but irrelvant. With [NAME] and [NAME] there I only see a no deal exit
4	I made friend with one of these scammers. After speaking to me he quit his job at that company. We still speak regularly over whatapp and facetime!
13	Let people enjoy things
4	Let's wait for January patch, and hope that your problems will be resolved soon. I have too much fun in this game right now :) 
7	Why thank you
6	I am confusion.
3	According to roadcam, everyone stops that far past the stop line and if you say you don't, you're a liar.
20	To be fair the lore is so nonexistent other than on Ubi’s site you could probably just pretend that’s the case anyways.
21	11 seconds. I'll try harder next time.
4	I fully agree. What works for one doesn't worth for another. Good luck.
2	Why would they stop there with like 15 feet of visibility? It clearly isn’t just the truck drivers fault
20	Just know that you are the man. Go Isles. Go Flames.
20	34 year old here... still feel like a 20 year old still trying to figure things out... no kids, no wife, 
7	Did she even pass the formidable Blechdel Test?

6	What does the buzz feel like?

20	I'd trust someone who is bound by regulation over [NAME] from Essex who blames immigrants cos he was fired for sleeping on the job
20	The table actually hit her in the back of the thighs, breaking her fall in the process. She was probably fine long-term
9	It was intentional. Maybe not with much thought behind it, but a very dangerous instinct.
4	Yeah you're right, I mistyped it. Should have said after 1st and after the 2nd. There's none after the 3rd.
1	lol you think you can get 21 back.
10	I couldn't agree more.
15	I am well aware of how immature and inconsiderate men are capable of being, but thanks for the reminder. Baby.
10	I don’t get why he hasn’t brought his insta account back, he did used to use it from time to time
2	I think it's racist to call yourself or anyone European. If you're born on Earth, you're an [NAME], separating yourself is Racist.
11	That’s not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that’s a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply.
20	Basically how I discovered I’m bi—

20	What have I watched ?! My eyes!!! Mom!!!

4	DoorDash will refund you if you didn’t receive it. Just contact their support.
23	I felt that way last year and then the Patriots let me down, so best to take no chances.
3	You must live in a cozy little bubble then.
6	Love the idea for the [NAME] skin but I think it might be too hard :/
1	Let the liar lie, it's more fun to watch.
4	Yeah with this and the other thread DoorDash is definitely down. Just go home and don't answer any 650 numbers

21	Fear - that's it. You need to work on identifying and overcoming your fears.

9	My kids graduated college two years ago. Guess I missed it?
15	Yessss thats it ...thanks
2	700 euros per week for 16 hour days 6 -7 days a week is shite and well below minimum wage if you work it out per hour.
20	Keep in mind with these verses you've selected you aren't mentioning how we must he crucified in the flesh with [NAME].
0	Sandwiching an argument between two insults. I like it - I might try it. Maybe that will get people to agree with me
20	If you stick a pinky in your butt it activates the hippo camping with us part of your brain.
0	Woodfield Mall is pretty good still.
15	Thank you. Message me.
20	IL is working double OT now to catch up to all that retardedness. They want ammo serialized ffs.
15	Thank you for that. My gf jumped right next to me! 😂😂😂
17	It’s saved in the cloud now lol

20	The last statement just seemed like a bit of a jibe.
0	He's an adorable person.
3	What the hell- they're paying for cars they don't and won't ever own?!
12	They keep teasing us with royal blue. It seems like it’s unofficially confirmed that they’re switching their color scheme back
4	Meh, same branch of religion. Just opposing views on the sequel to the story.
23	Yeah what do they expect? maybe they should realize if you push Gen [NAME] and under into poverty they won't be able to afford your crap.
0	Looks like a pretty good plate overall!!
11	“I am going to be going through a nasty divorce in a few years so I will need the money.” - [NAME]
6	Did he say skinny wieners?
5	It's okay. One day you won't be so sad and angry, and people will still accept you.
6	Oh. It really is [RELIGION]. I was wondering if that was a bad gag.
0	Not at all! It’s my pleasure
12	I thought he was trolling oops
20	>fabricated moral high ground The irony of saying that as everyone here jerk's themselves off to a meme
4	You can't control if you're nervous or not, but just know that you will absolutely be judged for it. Consciously or subconsciously.
2	What an immature response. With a little passive agressive racism to boot. Classy.
20	I wanna see [NAME] get in [NAME] face like this
10	[NAME] yer fucked.
5	i luckily became really good friends with one. we definitely helped each other process our pain from him... so surreal how well they spin those lies

23	If he were to come to the table with fewer red lines the EU might make different concessions.
12	I mean, they called you ugly either way. It's not like they change their mind if you don't take the money.
27	I can't believe people voted us to beat Sydney. I've become extremely optimistic over the past few months and even i voted Sydney.
22	I was jumping the same gun but decided to do some googling just in case. Glad I did :)
26	I honestly couldn’t care less about your opinion at this point
20	Definitely not angry. He who smelt it dealt it.
4	This is the kind of thing that makes me want to move away far into the mountains away from civilization.
0	Wow. [NAME] is a giant POS. He'll be really happy being single and dying alone.

1	So true! I’ve always wondered why this is? I’m skinny as all hell and ppl tell me this all the time lol.
9	I'm a little disappointed that the tier markings werent' just different shades of green.

20	Why come here to spread hate?
20	You just blew my mind. Why haven't I thought of that before. You think someone would have explored that far east.
25	Most importantly, their first bill was to reopen the government. Period. I won't bother insulting you because I feel sorry for you.

20	It kind of replaces the home button, you use it to swipe up and out of an open app
2	Love the gif but I bloody hate these kinds of captions. It's as annoying and cringey as a fully grown adult doing baby-talk.
3	Funny that you name her when shes one of the only judges that uses her brain and ethics to make decisions.
20	dude imagine how [NAME] felt when he copped a full powered one from Barboza.

0	Ah Princess [NAME], the [NAME] of our childhoods
20	[NAME] dropped his career high on them last season.
3	I accidentally swiped. I don't have time right now I swiped for ego and got it so I don't actually want to talk to anyone.
10	Yep. That whole second kid thing is no joke.... Soon this will be a distant memory. That’s what I tell myself
0	That was so damn cute. She looks just like [NAME] and I bet it just melts his heart to see how mature that girl is
6	Welp....I think your question came across as judgmental. Why did you ask it?
4	you can't damage anything other than on foot players right now, no turrets, no vehicles, no objectives, it has been bugged since the december update

0	that's really good
0	It's the best, I haven't been so happy in a long time!
1	Not claming [NAME] would make [NAME] look more stupid lol. If someone claimed [NAME] we'd be over the moon about getting that contract off our team for next year.

4	Bench coming in strong. Let's go trey!

7	Interesting isnt it?
20	Just walk ahead of everyone and be the leader
27	Time flies when you're a semiprofessional quotemaker. I wonder what he's up to these days.
15	Yeah I think I’ll just wait until things are more sure. Thanks so much!
20	I feel the same on [NAME]. She's trying too hard to be hard-hitting etc. Thought she was poor on Thursday.
4	Yeah I agree with you tbh. A rough patch of form from us and the 5 point lead could be gone fast
1	Lol religion is a crazy thing
21	"> ""I have full confidence in [NAME]..."" *Now* you are being diplomatic."
3	Mate she looks like a feckin quality street
9	Why are our trolls so boring :(

3	He's being so unprofessional. He's out for blood for some reason.

7	Who is this?
22	Inspiring music that makes you proud.
1	Jajaja (hahaha)
4	Very light onset compared to the Pharma 10s I had past year. Arrived ND though so no regrets.
10	You see that's why you don't give tuna and catnip to the neighborhood cats because then they'll never leave.
20	Daily Wire is a hate site, and [NAME] is a bigot.
15	I love those examples. Thank you for sharing. 🙏
20	Off her meds
13	I had big plans in life when I met this guy and two years later, nothing has materialized. Yes, I also feel frozen in time. 
20	I need a do over!!!! At least I’m not the only one lol, solidarity ✌️
25	Bet Highland Council are sorry they sold their bunker last year.
20	We can work on both. Ignore centrists who want to pretend that we have to choose.
3	I used to work with a guy that was always whining how tough his life was. My family this, my friends that. Very annoying
21	She had the glory of being a virgin martyr. Eternal glory is hers.
0	You good.
9	I put so much thought into things that often I trigger myself unintentionally. I can be hurt before something has a chance to happen.
6	I think this is very relevant, u/lilhan2
20	When [NAME] like “should we have an alien baby” and [NAME] looked SO happy 😂💛
20	But it is! People totally shame you for only wanting one!
15	Might do that, thank you!
20	Strong and stable...
0	She does have a great ass I’ve always thought so
2	"[NAME]: ""WTF, it's just a prank bro!"""
0	I love Arkansas. /s.
0	All the things you mentioned are basically aligned perfectly in 99% of cases.
2	20 cents we use to pay in our small takeaway shop wtf are you talking about
7	Messages like this will always get replies from me, even if it had been about erm punching me?!
9	I'm sorry but I would've have pressed charges on the guy who kicked me in the ribs while I was being held down.
20	Looks like Russian agitprop is pivoting to Tulsi. [NAME] can kiss his chances for 2020 goodbye.
7	How is it the worst though? Me and my friends all use it and love it (since 2016)
26	They are all secretly projecting their own cheating onto us. Emotionally stunted 5 year olds with zero impulse control will do that.
5	I'm on your side with this one. At least you have some legs to stand on.
20	"Whatever conclusion they reach now or in the future, the only constant will be that ""nothing should be done to stop it."""

3	By pushing misleading and false information, your agenda is dividing [NAME].
25	I killed them for the first time in my most recent playthrough and regretted it. The replacement council sucks just as hard.
20	No I’m just following your logic. To avoid pain people should die. Life is pain so people in pain should die. It’s your exact logic
20	I imagine that 50 years ago that's exactly the position he would take
19	He has made threats saying if he sees me on the street he will attack me that’s what the situation boiled down to
25	This used to be a lot more common when I was younger. So weird.
9	But but r/49ers said it was just bad luck!
20	[NAME]? For real?
20	Misleading title, his administration cut all programs using fetal tissue, not HIV stuff specifically. Still sucks though.
3	Who said anyone was white or black? Forget it, trumpie. You clowns don’t care about the truth. 
4	At least there’s still more likes than dislikes
19	You are gone right now probably my trip is just kicking in i took half that amount lol cuz im low you are having a hell of a ride rn
4	Just because some people troll him on Twitter and get literally no retweets or interactions, he'll surely change his way of directing...
20	Love me some incel gammer rage, pure gold
20	Show them your hymen
20	WHY IS THERE WOMAN ON MY ENTERTAINMENT??????????
3	And we know how [NAME] ended. [NAME] should run away like now.
20	>This erotic art from a borderline fan. FTFY

0	3 under 3?! You are a true hero.
20	Those are separate issues from the sample size.
3	It was so frustrating seeing him overthrow people every week. I hope he makes that a point of focus this off-season.
1	Dudes karma is -99 lol
12	heh, I remember that commercial.. Was pretty cringy

3	The parallel to the mistake you're making is so apparent I no longer believe you're discussing this in good faith.

1	That would be fun
4	And yes I also thought [NAME] was someone else too!

7	Is there any example in History where a 'multicultural' society has succeeded to the point of them becoming a major power?
2	[NAME] ONLY WANTS STUPID VERONICAS AND STACIES AND NOT US, GAYS RISE UP
20	They most likely did, since they still having bank issues.
2	I cannot believe the fucking audacity of him. Have some shame for [NAME] sake.
20	You can see [NAME] weapon on the plane in the background when [NAME] is talking
3	You really shouldn’t just pat wolves you know...
11	ooooooo...yikes
3	The worst thing about this tweet is how many likes and retweets it got
20	You just need to ignore him. He only crawls out when he can complain about traditional [NAME] or dem stupid republicans.
0	The best part of froyo is getting to do it yourself. Robot is useless and bad at it's job.
10	Too ugly for love/romance/sex/dating

20	I'll be surprised if *Monty Python's Life of Brian* wasn't one of those.

18	I'd love to hear a man explain why men do this
20	Arrg. I never should have let my mother in via SMS. At least it's only SMS.
20	You're a turd
20	I can't tell if this is satire of not. It's got this whole [NAME] and [NAME] dad rock vibe going on.

18	Wow I’ve never seen that one and I love it! Could you share the picture?
1	Lol you're so close to getting it, dude. So close. 
3	Your “[NAME]” is a train wreck at social media. Only skill he’s shown so far

20	"Yeah the only ""compromise"" is get married ASAP so you can have sex again (which is a HORRIBLE idea)."
10	No, he said he's bringing in somewhere around 10K a month, not 2500 a month. That's a HUGE income gap.
2	Looks like one of mine too. Such a horribly raised entitled rude brat
20	No no! I meant it in a positive way. The emotional rollercoaster of the photo album.
3	When I was her age I had 3 jobs... oh you have like 18... get off my lawn!

15	Wow. Thanks for this.
11	I mean it sucks but that man looks deaded
11	[NAME] doesn't seem to have based this on anything. The owner of the nightclub says there was no altercation at
23	My wife is not allowed to flick my ears for any reason, and apparently I'm not allowed to stick my finger into her bellybutton lmao.
20	At that point you might as well pay a visit to his home instead of suing. His house is a google search away.
1	"Well, actually it is a joke on how mansplainers often start their mansplaining with: ""well, actually""."
20	Our [NAME] is going off bro. [NAME] is gonna out-Jack you off.
7	The fact she'd want her daughter with someone as awful as [NAME] is strange. And what's wrong with [NAME] that she would stay with him ?
4	Correct but Reddit won't admit that as the reason.
20	Nice try Tyler 1
20	Just thought it was a clever title, no revenge really
3	Not loving what I'm seeing so far, let's hope we can tighten it up.

20	I heard not too long ago that they had homophobic ads too. They also play multiple ads through a 10 minute video which irritates me.
20	The ID cards wouldn't have been a problem if they were like the EU one. It was the fuckload of biometric data that was abhorrent.
7	So, a kid?
18	I like my coons too
20	Now, could you please turn the card around and show me those wacky three numbers on the back. 
11	its not even illegal for like siblings and parents/children to have sex as long as they are adults and consenting when the relationship begins.
20	Shouldn’t have told them how much they cost, as they advised they knew they were expensive and that it was ok.

8	It's also my 40th birthday, so bring a gift! 
17	Today's Recaptchas were fun. I'm very good at identifying store fronts, apparently...

2	I mean. Wtf is there to do online. GTAO had a shit economy but at least had things to do
7	Why do you want it to be the world's leader and savior, outta broken and needs some alone time. 
4	Well, since everything in Australia wants to kill you, I'd say it is quite healthy to be afraid of Australian spiders, and other flora and fauna 
20	I've been out of the country for the past week, has [NAME] stopped sitting on the fence and stated support for remain in that time?
0	Hey, I get your point of view. I appreciate the explanation. :)

20	[NAME]? He doesn't steal it, and he acts like shep in me2. But yeah, the picture looks like [NAME], more than a femshep. 
20	No particular sauce, I'm just kinda tired of having to search that tiny lil speck of pan for at least 2 minutes before I find it.
1	Nah man [NAME] gets made fun of more than anyone lmao
20	Cardinals/ [NAME] MNF. Give the people what they really want!!
20	Of course it's going backwards, people generally don't want to acknowledge men as the people that hold society on their backs.
7	Yea I've heard this also so that's why I'm curious how well this one will last.
20	I saved it on my memories/highlights
9	I am so relieved

4	GIVE HIM ALL THE MINUTES
23	huge fool just like everyone who believes anything [NAME] says weve been two weeks away for months now

10	We’re not upset. We’re disgusted. You’re disgusting.

4	Well shit, then it's just like [NAME] wouldn't let me complete a maths degree just because I'm ideologically opposed to this 'algebra' thing!
19	This would make me sick.Getting cucked by bayern on and off the field.
6	Well obviously not. Some people have higher tolerances than others. That’s a fact. I don’t know what else to tell you.
6	Launching a jab is a hard commitment though, right? Because I doubt you can react fast enough to seeing them jab and launch them.
10	I don't see much reason for it even as a 2nd.

21	That person my friend, you will remember till the day you die. The simple treasures. 
6	Hard to tell
10	I don't think he was going to catch that bus if he didn't hit the pole.

19	a lot. It's like I'm witnessing firsthand all of the unpleasant symptoms of being pregnant
5	Maybe you feel a pressure to succeed and that makes it harder to do so

15	Thanks for gping to the effort, but i would be surprised if he read it and gave it the chance he have trump. Pleasantly surprised, though.
18	And dedmon is expiring. So he likely would have walked for nothing. Huge win

1	He's not the [NAME] he's just a very naughty boy!
4	its pretty wholesome tho

20	Grant us pies, grant us pies.
27	Wow, so that means common tongue isn’t English!?!
1	I'm sure you do lmfao...
10	He's controversial from what I know. A canny leader to be sure, but his coziness with Dominion Energy has unnerved some [NAME]. 
15	Thank you for mentioning that!
3	Many of them are actively being courted and convinced by People's Vote activists. You just actively avoid acknowledging that fact.

9	Thank you [NAME].. Another disaster you created.
4	I bet you get tired of people looking through your post history and using your anti-semitism to dismiss you as utter trash too.
20	Honestly I think most of that sort of stuff existed between the 1985-2012-ish. Depending on your age most young people would have experienced these.
4	what has helped me was to figure out the root cause of the anger and address those feelings rather than hold onto the anger.

20	it was a big improvement over when I was younger and we went to carman concerts
20	P o R Z I n G I S
11	It's ephemeral. It deteriorates in quality from the second you finish pouring. It isn't going to be framed. Enjoy the moment.
20	Yes. However, they also could've just gotten something catered.
13	Me too! So pumped! Enjoy the game, bud!
20	And congrats on them being part of the 10,000 too!

20	[NAME] what's your opinion on this?
21	Ugh. Nice season from him, hoping he can build on it next year and play a bigger role at the world juniors.
20	You can remove them without killing or etc etc. Just stop reproduction
3	I want to bounce a whole roll of quarters off that ass, holy shit.
16	That was painful to read.

20	Uh, no. Not even remotely.
10	I get it but it wasn't what i was talking about.

3	Since [NAME] are technically [NAME].
1	Lmao. I fucking love this community.
20	@AOC for President 2028!

26	I am pleased to report that my 5 win streak was broken.
20	Someone on r/nba said [NAME] was borderline elite defensively...lol
0	It's gorgeous
19	It's just a human problem. I lose track of how many stories a month come out about some teacher getting caught sexually abusing 1-3 of her students.
21	I really hope [NAME] gets a great helm. A crown would be cool but I want a properly armored sword and board knight.
3	"I would pay money for [NAME] to not be my nurse. She will probably ""accudentally"" squeeze my nuts. Crazy bitch."
20	Vamos [NAME], keep fighting! 
17	So cool! Me and my sissy got the same but on our arms! On twitter!
10	Ignoring the refs for a second, [NAME] defense always does well against us

0	Much appreciated! I'll surely come back and let everyone know what I find!
20	All children should be given the option to learn about how to effectively use the rights they’re entitled to.
3	[NAME] i feel personally attacked
20	I think most of these pictures would be much scarier if we had the perspective of the guy
6	Then yeah, not really. I can't think of a specific type of evolutionary pressure that would lead us to developing an ability like that.
21	That was one of the things that I didn't think about and I already gave a delta for that.
19	No particular sauce, I'm just kinda tired of having to search that tiny lil speck of pan for at least 2 minutes before I find it.
2	At least I dont care about any of them.
3	If you eat plants, you are eating animal’s food. That is so cruel!
6	As opposed to becoming a U.S. citizen the illegal way?

20	BY [NAME] THAT'S [NAME] MUSIC!
11	Pure unadulterated hatred. It’s disgusting.
0	Such a great thing to hear. Setting aside my very immense distaste for SA, this really just makes me happy. I love our country.
4	I think I'm overly defensive tbh... but yeah this relationship will be ending when I see him next.
15	Ok im om the hunt thanks
20	Now that I've seen this, I would like to petition that Warden is just another sentient suit of armour.
4	I think they were talking about the learning proccess. [NAME] succeded as well. So, 3 of them.
1	I wonder so too hehe :D
3	When you're too stupid to realize they showed off character customization in the trailer...

3	Couldn't happen to a nicer piece of shit.

3	If it was low-fat mayonnaise, their response may have been justified. That stuff is horrendous.
20	Hello please repost with names censored. :) <3 xoxo hugs and disco kisses
6	I guess the caveat is that is a world championship offyear where not all players are available due to playoffs
26	I really miss AG
20	[NAME] has the best facial expressions LOL. Her face is literally this emoji: 😒
1	Breaking news- Man having fun at party is mocked by basement dwelling redditor.
20	Don’t say his name!!
13	Can’t wait to see this monster perp walk.
4	Timestamp it for me then, apparently I didn't listen when Mom said that would make me go blind. 
15	That was something I was told as well. It makes sense. Thanks for verifying that as an option.
27	That would look enormous if [NAME] ordered it!
20	*looks at title* IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?!?!?!?!?!?
20	Other than ignoring [NAME] PTSD
21	Think of his target audience. They’re the ones who are fooled by talkers, not thinkers.
5	Aw bummer. She lost her screenshot of the copy of a copy of bullshit articles handwritten in 1992. Somebody help a girl out.
0	He looks like a genuinely nice guy. He doesn’t look fat and greasy
20	It doesn't sound like there is much that isn't a waste of money in your opinion.
20	Yeah but you don't know if they're responsible for 2018 yet. Have to wait another year.
4	Agree with everything here. Going to med school abroad will always put you at a disadvantage if you want to practice in the states

18	I love how she has no idea what to do. Like stop drop and roll 🤦‍♂️
8	Baby dont misunderstand..why cant I be head coach
21	No, but even if you did, you'll find nothing special.

15	I’m sorry I only have orange ones :(
7	Cured her depression, didn't it? 
27	"What a very ""centrist"" thing to say. "
10	slander? it's only slander if it's untrue, and all I said was that you don't grasp satire, which is obviously true.
18	Wow I’ve never seen that one and I love it! Could you share the picture?
4	Yes, listening to loud noises can damage your ears. Temporarily and permanently.

6	Same. I see some people just look really friendly, or just familar. 
25	Sorry for the late question but I wanted to know if can you buy 2 tickets with one Madridista membership? Or is it one ticket per Madridista membership?
11	It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about
10	Except when you get put against the same 6 stack 5 times in a row and they smash you every time... was not a good time
20	The government won't let scientists do studies on it, so we're stuck with anecdata until they stop being assholes.
0	Nice try russia
4	Probably cause our FBs are not strong enough defensively so we need a way to justify playing them
2	Wtf? Really?
23	That's not the plan. If it were, the backstop wouldn't be controversial. The plan is divergence.
5	No pain or anything, I didn’t even notice it was gone until I looked. It was an interesting experience 
20	Ok I'm pretty sure [NAME] has been part of the main cast since episode 1...
2	[NAME] fuck those creeps
2	It’s all the anger, it ages her terribly 
23	You do realize that this is the sub for non-Trump supporters to come ask questions to [NAME] supporters. The OPs are all non-Trump supporters

8	Love the view. I would love to drink rum with a view like that. Have fun!
20	Do you think the kid was crazy or was the mom crazy? Or do you think it was a bit of both?
10	I don't understand how her hair is 'too light' or how that effects the concealer.
0	These videos are legendary
23	My friend with BPD has just done this very thing when I moved down to their city. Have become a total stranger.
2	>marry up tho Except it's more cruel for men now. The men who the said women are seeing are most certainly homeless/broke chads.
20	as the old saying goes, we know what they all r, just trying to negoiate the price.
3	I don’t like [NAME] very much either, but she’s not a mess here. 
18	Best time to stop lurking, you know why? So I can see your handsome face 
9	I always cry when [NAME] is on screen.

20	You gotta know [NAME] is willing to pull the trigger on you at any moment if it means he can fleece another gm.

1	Everyone seems to forget how much he sucked as a quarterback, there’s a reason he was un drafted
15	Thank goodness for that!

13	The Oscars at least banned applauding years ago
0	You're far too sweet haha
3	"you said that he said ""women shouldn't be allowed in the workplace"" which is dishonest and false"
20	[NAME] are already in negotiations for a licensed game about shaving and toxic masculinity.
4	Good deeds don't buy off being shitty. This is why [NAME] is remembered as a monster.
20	I just wish she could do this on the show more readily
20	Did the Bears corners really play that well or was their front 7 so dominant that it made them look better?
11	That was so disgusting. VWP
27	Right, that makes sense! I wonder if the person I met in real life would acknowledge he's more of a fence sitter than childfree, haha
0	That's some legendary teamwork exhibited right there.
3	A pencil skirt is tight around the hips with a slit in the back, not swishy. Does that make sense?
3	Well, never thought I'd be here, but here I am, someone who passionately hates the Florida Panthers 
20	[NAME] campaign donation at work apparently. Sure didn't take long.
3	This is probably why you're not in a relationship.
17	Feels good bruh
13	Can't wait

7	What about [NAME]? [NAME] I hate her.
0	I love the outfit that [NAME] is wearing
20	That explains quite a bit.
13	My body is ready for our Tank Commanders return!

1	Exactly right! It would help if my fingers could type properly lol. Burr smh!
6	Should this be tagged nsfw for the knot?
20	>Charters get to choose who they take Not in Los Angeles. Admissions is by lottery.
6	that's weird, I thought we already had too many outfielders? edit: this was a joke.
23	I would play the fuck out of this game
1	It's good worrying about things that can be helped. Lol
15	Thank you!! That’s me as [NAME]!
17	That was fun.
7	Also, do you have a link with updates? I cannot find any reports like this. 
3	They are children, they have no souls. 
1	That'll be a testical festival for sure. Have fun.
23	Happens every time. Your just playing the with your sibling and then someone accidently hits the other and it turns in to world war 3.
5	Don't apologize it has nothing to do with you, everyone here understands that.
4	I completely agree! It's cold at first but makes you feel so alive and invigorated by it too. It's a total shock to the system.
1	Hahahah holy shit, yes it does.
17	I'd steal that!... just as cool.
0	I don't know what the main broadcast is like, but the MNF crew is amazing.
7	But according to [NAME] [NAME] didn’t use a phone to contact [NAME], right? Also, Oct 5?
4	That's clearly a clickbait title. Chances are it didn't actually happen.
20	4 year old. The hardest part is only seeing him half the time bc I’m the primary care giver in the family
21	whoops I still hope they press that legislation though
14	Philanthropy really scares some people, doesn't it? People did this to [NAME] too. 
20	xD Add it to the meme list guys
0	Huge goal for [NAME]. Big confidence boost for the mistakes from the start of the season!

20	You’re the meme this sub jokes about.
27	...what?
10	culver's is good shit edit: not saying that you were saying it was bad, just to clarify
17	my favourite depictions of [NAME] and the gang are the ones where [NAME] is stoic and sassy and [NAME] and [NAME] are super emotional goofballs
20	Normally yes, but then it would be an attractive woman (at least it used to be).
18	I am so sorry for your loss and all the stress you have right now. All the internet hugs you want right now! <3
20	wondering what the hookup scene is like in the north woods of Wisconsin?
20	Welp see you in eternity!!!
0	I feel you. Most look generic af. I've seen some absolutely stunning ones though. Like [NAME]. She's a 10/10 IMO.
25	Sorry, I’m out of the loop- are they on this season as well? I forgot about them
20	Meth and booze.
3	food pranks really irk me 😔
20	Don't forget [NAME] being nerfed because she was unfun to play against in QM, then being reworked, then being nerfed again for the same reason.
4	I have friends who drove from interior Alaska to Arizona in less than 48 hours... It's possible.
27	Considering you are also a child, I can't say I'm surprised by your edgy hot take.
20	Poisoned by his enemies.
20	Just be her friend. Don’t try to have sex with her.
1	Lmaoooo alright sure you did hardo.
6	You look chunky
20	I just don’t understand this.
15	[NAME] looking good for a big game
20	7x04 for me, but I like the positivity. It was one of my best episodes of the season.
20	No one is holding a gun to their heads telling them to moderate the sub, either. 
20	>[NAME] well, there's your problem
1	This is very accurately funny and sad. 🤦🏻‍♂️
13	Yaaaay!!
19	My darling, have you bowed down to worship the ancient one yet? We are very worried. 
12	Not really someone I despise, but definitely someone I was ashamed of.
0	Wow that’s actually a great idea lmao
20	Rose coloured glasses get rosier as time goes by :) You'll move on eventually. Treasure the memory but be present in your current and future relationships.
2	Your passion for [NAME] literally put a big smile on my face. Stay wavy!
20	It's an Albany expression
25	Collusion! Nah but seriously, Knicks need to fall back. 
10	One of the most posted things on reddit. Please delete

15	Thanks so much! I'll let you know how it goes when I get a chance to try it :)
1	starting a new trend lol
1	Funny how the [NAME] leaves the most important item out of their article headline.
9	Nah, I know why I am depressed, and I'm sorry to say it has nothing to do with you. 
20	Meritocracy ftw!
6	Did you check the bowl?
27	Shockingly, some people continue to educate and improve themselves. You might benefit from it.
20	Yep. Id say ever since Diablo 3 it was shown that the company was no more. They no longer were gamers making games for gamers.
9	Dopey may is still relevant. Delors is not. So your comparison falls flat. Do try keep up.
20	Sounds like he wants to strongly pretend he's not paying for sex.
5	If you like Thai food, try Firefly.
20	Wasn't north and south Dakota one state at some point? Are they putting aside they're difference and getting back together?
20	Baseless assumptions about cops on Reddit without any context?
10	Nope, not my department.
20	That works too. To each their own.
0	I can’t stop staring at the boobs
3	Dumpster fire. I cant quit you Edmonton!!
23	I've heard of alligator boots, but I always thought that meant something else.
2	Dude what's wrong with you? 4 years in a secret relationship.. you shouldn't be in one of your not comfortable telling people
20	ESPN said [NAME] doesn't deserve to because he should have the Pistons playing better and shouldn't be on the outside looking into the playoffs right now
26	Which is why not only did PR lose but RUP was not the first choice sadly even if it had won in BC :(
3	 Calm down and relax are the worst things to say to a woman, ever. 
4	This. Fans complain that she's boring but I'm actually glad she's careful about what she allows to be filmed.
4	"I didn't say ""do it for the children,"" but I understand if reading isn't a strong suit for you."
0	Way to go! I know who this couple is! they appear really happy!
20	Wanna know how hard I hit it? I hit it into next week.
3	And then they clapped and gave you $100, I'm sure
2	Seems highly unethical for a lawyer to sign exclusive coverage contracts on their pending cases.
15	u/-adamsmith perfect troll account name, but at least he united all of r/MLS. Thanks for teaming up, everyone.
18	I love it.
17	Poor fella just got his arms out of plaster and we’re already making fun of him
13	Thank you. Yeah it's a nice thought, being sheltered and happy before any worries or drama. It would be nice...
1	I didn’t know I could roll my eyes this far into my head
17	giving great [NAME] vibes
6	After how badly the Patriots screwed CT, how can anyone like them?
0	I had no idea what the fuck this was about. Found the ad and watched it. It's actually decent.
6	I admitted to myself that I had no other reason to think [NAME] was real. Kind of tough to stay [RELIGION], after that. 
15	Thanks!! Been avoiding this but I literally am in that area for the Elk pelt so I better put my emotions in a case
0	[NAME] Late Registration my favorite and Gone my favorite song even though it's hard as fuck to choose
6	Why it got removed.
17	i'm enjoying this so much
17	I suppose I failed to lay the sarcasm on thick enough, should have gone with the full billion dollar contract... Oh well, live and learn! lol 
2	It's hard to respect them as an organization when we hear shit like this. They will struggle as a franchise to win another WS anytime soon.
20	It would be quite difficult, considering that I don't actually have any to begin with, hence the question. 
20	Wait wait wait... did [NAME] go 61-27??
0	She’s so hot. Also happy cake day
20	Didn't [NAME] say that [NAME] was going to be on?
26	This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
4	Omg I thought he was actually fired lol. Got excited ! I still approve tho
20	What is a punishment if not an undesirable consequence imposed by others?
20	And you didn't read the filler did you?
11	That pedo ring that developed under [NAME] tenure makes him the worst owner of a sports team ever, bar none.
23	if HL in offensive stance dodges it, then doesn't raider also dodge it? Or is that fast recovery into moves that are not dodging again?
3	Do as I say, Not as I do
2	stupid science bitches
20	Politicians be like yo we cant raise minimum wage because then companies will just replace all their workers with robots...
20	Think about it as a normal match then be confident in your play.
21	Good luck!
20	Oh, with that title I thought the crocodile was gonna- oh.
20	If they actually have more evidence that he was deeper than originally suspected, then I have no sympathy.
13	Ty going through a lot right now and this made me smile.
1	That's crazy; I went to a super [RELIGION] high school and I think I can remember 2 girls the entire 4 years that became teen moms.
20	More like lovely shiny apples and rotten oranges covered with mold.
5	Damn girl, Stockholm syndrome is strong with you. All I can say is I wish you all the best.
20	[NAME] already had that in their comment and I didn't deny it. I guess that level of attention to detail isn't taught at Bellevue Community College.
6	Why or when was he ever a locker room cancer though? Am I missing something? Thanks for the downvote for asking a question, though. 
7	Unbelievable! Here. Have your iPad back. Not interested in being treated like a criminal. I’ll write home with pen and paper
0	She looks pretty big to me. I doubt she’s within a healthy weight range.
20	The real joke is always in the comments.
10	so you can't state it definitively, therefore you think it's a possibility so i was right all along. i thought so
27	Wow, I know he is the voice of [NAME], but I did not know he basically IS [NAME]
15	I've heard of Ne Obliviscaris and the Ocean. I'll check these out, thanks!
27	ISN'T YOUR CLUB RUN BY A JABBA-THE-HUT-LOOKING DONALD-TRUMP-ACTING MORON WITH A ~~FIVE SIX SEVEN TEN~~ FIFTEEN YEAR PLAN?
20	No thank you, we need to tank, and this moves us 1 gb from the #6 pick :)
0	I'm sure he immensely appreciates the gesture.
20	DONT DO IT PRELLER
20	Kawhi and Siakam chemistry
9	The smile on these guys face, the will and passion to explore all gone in a second. Rest in peace explorers!
20	For the love of all that is good and holy, please find competent broadcasters NBCSN.
20	Idk man, some people just have wack combinations. I'm a Yankees/Panthers/Jazz fan, it doesn't have to make any sense. 
18	My wife's birthday today, we are going for dinner with my lovely girlfriend later, after meeting at ours for coffee and cake. Very happy
20	Much less legal racism, much more corruption, crime, dysfunction, decay etc
20	AM I BEING DETAINED?
20	“[NAME] bring the wipers, I thought I farded but I accidentally shidded.”
3	Sucks when people misunderstand philosophy right
20	I’m not arguing for it. I just think the punishment doesn’t fit the crime.
25	oh wow never heard of that in my life sorry
24	At last, someone I can share this accomplishment with! 
27	Wow I bet someone would look at this and get inspired to make a movie about aliens with [NAME]
18	this is why I love reddit
16	Nah it's a sexual disorder due to brain structure not aligning with body structure but continue to be an ignorant transphobe I guess.
20	And mass migration
7	This is in vaucluse ?
9	I Said that’s it’s unrealistic that he take gear !
7	what's a friend
6	Now I'm over thinking. Maybe I have justified it to be able to move on and get closure???
11	It's not free, though. It's ridiculously expensive.
20	Honestly capital G god is probaby the only diety I would struggle allowing at my table, no matter which [NAME] religion it was picked from.
22	He also owes [NAME]. a little payback.
0	Very handsome!!
4	That's fine. I'm searching for the truth, not just the legal truth. To each their own. 
1	I want to see him succeed. Mostly because his last name makes me think of the bad guy from Shrek
0	Nice job dude!
8	Yeah I realised that a bit too late. I still wanted to further explain myself regardless but thank you for being nice about it.
18	I love how that's pretty much all they can do, literally beg for him not to run.
20	All Dressed Ruffles are my vice, but potato chips make me sick. I wouldn't go so far as to lick the seasoning off, though..
3	Oh fuck off already.
20	So I'll just hide behind my newspaper then.
5	"Kids, if you're on a dating site that advertises itself as ""dating site for millionaires"" you're gonna have a bad time"
10	That wasn’t part of my plan
9	It’s a really depressing show. Kinda like Mad Men.
0	I once got flowers from a girl... idk why but it just feels good
7	I’m slowly starting to get excited about what we will do with the draft pick(s?) they will most likely get in a trade
20	The BBC covered up a pedophile story involving high ranking politicians. No thank you. They are basically the public relations branch of the government.
4	She has major SB😖
2	Aaaaaand they turned it off. Terrible roads everywhere.
20	I don't think I've ever seen that flag flying in this city, we mostly just have the provincial flag and the Canada flag
4	We're in this together! Pandora's box has been opened! There is no turning back!
3	Ok this New England accent not so fun!!
8	I like to support anybody who supports veganism, especially at places like this, to show them their is a demand, and a future for it
15	Your welcome.
6	Wasn't the scar originally across his nose but [NAME] moved it?
5	They remembered [NAME]
5	But beat the warriors Celtics and rockets. Pistons love messing with our emotions
9	Because there isn’t an unlimited supply of beautiful 20-year-olds.
21	Volunteer. Helping people in need will make you feel better about both yourself and others.
20	Hi I’m [NAME], why don’t you take a seat over there.
1	Now we all know someone is going to domesticate these cute fluff butts
16	Sad. My condolences to her family.
10	I hate this comment. More-so, I hate how likely this comment is to reach fruition. 
8	I wish they let him do the quatrains once a week during the NFL season.
1	that missed dunk is so symbolic of [NAME] lol
4	Yeah, the gauntlet ruins everything
20	It's more laid back, which I kinda love.
1	Lol, nah, that team was nothing more than nyxl and friends. Nyxl coach, and mostly nyxl players.
18	[NAME], you are such a pretty girl. 
13	Ayyy you're welcome! x)
12	My bad on the phrasing, it’s more of a hole with a vent cover 
23	Funny because I only owe 20k... I guess no one told these kids community college exists.
0	I think Limmy's Show is really hit and miss. Some sketches are funny, others are just poor.
20	I would get up and gently wake the guy-he could have broken his jaw-
20	You’re doing gods work.
20	"Finally, a real ""murderedbywords"" than the constant string of silly roasts."
20	Let's kill and eat them all. That'll stop those damned animals from deforesting my forests
6	Not sure if I'm having a woosh moment or you think I meant something else...
20	Get more crushes.
20	True :/
18	I love how he looks around for a flag and doesn’t celebrate at first
4	I feel like [NAME] had the right idea losing the will to live. Now if only I could learn this power...
20	culver's is good shit edit: not saying that you were saying it was bad, just to clarify
9	Too late with having it back. I really did'nt have much back then. So I had a really hard time too.
4	I was hoping to hear this. I'm up for it I think. I'll download it tomorrow.
5	Why? They deserve it.
10	Idiots are downvoting your correct comment.
15	Thank [NAME].
8	Can't you tell that [NAME] is a serious threat to apprehend. All that alleged lying makes him a serious threat to others.
6	So kinda like an assistant? Interesting
9	someone should of grabbed [NAME] by his foot and use him as a club to bash [NAME]..
23	[NAME] with the truth that reality show does not = relevance.
7	Seriously. I wonder if OP has seen some of the amazingly stupid faces that [NAME] and [NAME] make.
0	“Our decaf is like really good tho gurl, you’ll be okay”
0	Just tell her how you feel and make the next move
7	I'm genuinely curious how Russia's vested interest in South Africa will have any impact on the way that Russian news reports on SA
20	In the Garden of Femininity, of course!
9	I know right I was very disappointed when I saw who it was
7	Just for the sake of accuracy, is there a citation for this quotation. It is spicy, but I can’t bother to check right now.
12	I feel I should do this even after living here for 7 years, I've barely done any touristy things! Shame on me.
20	And he will...Hence he shrugs off whatever you said and continues to treat dashers like trash.
20	Boom. Sand. Great image
2	Oh we’re TANKING tanking
10	Well one of our leading candidates is [NAME] so it's not like we're killing it in our search either
20	I'm guessing that it maybe due to being overwhelmed w/ responses and having a relatively small staff to go through all the forms.
20	When my Dad ([NAME] all the way) is Tsar of the Earth I'll have him make doxxing a crime with mandatory sentencing to terrible things.
22	Hey I’m going to eli today! Unfortunately for a funeral but hello stranger :)
3	The whole post reeks of troll.
2	Not only do they make me cringe, I become angry because usually or is my nmother and her flying monkey daughter posting them. Just horrible.
20	I hardly ever post in r/bitcoin. But then, r/Bitcoin isn't pretending Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.
20	Just to set up for a bigger failure story in the coming days. I think the guys at epoch times are working extra hours this weekend.
20	I have never noticed dread doing shady stuff. Dream, well, duh.
15	Thank you for the link I'm going to post their also
20	Also featuring the dat ass meme in the 2nd panel and the LOL rage face in the 4th. Both ancient but apparently still considered funny by some.
27	The way it took out that tree!!
20	There to busy guzzling down Russian propoganda , to enact a final solution on tmor.
3	Are you confessing to not being able to understand what this sub is about?
26	Did that with an oven pizza at 3am in my underwear. Got burns all over my stomach
10	Ah, didn’t know that but can’t blame him. Thanks!
0	Da’ts a beauty. Got sniped at auction with seconds left to lose [NAME] from this summer.
18	If you have any other links handy I'd love to see them.
20	You’re a genius.
20	No femshaming, guys.
20	I'm surprised [NAME] didn't bust that dress open when she bent down to high [NAME]
20	Since you seem to have posted this twice, I would recommend you take this down.
20	She is :(
5	> Books. Love them, have enough The library is your friend :)
11	Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.
10	Haha WEHO, for West Hollywood, not Wehoe for We hoes
7	What else did you expect?
2	That's the main reason to play [NAME]? I hate it too.
6	Are they sure one didn't kill the other and themselves?
0	Don't see it at all, but she's cute with the freckles
26	I think I got gout from watching this.
20	You got shafted.
11	Everyone makes mistakes tho... at least he only allowed 1 mistake to go for a goal
20	Because it's like she's a child, though it would be weird to explain it right then.
25	always try to avoid triggers - my last 12 day streak was suddenly toppled by a trigger - no urges and then, suddenly, a *massive* urge
27	Anyone know how high of a fall that was? Edit: ~4 seconds of falling. .5 X 9.8 X 4^2 = ~78 feet.
2	Astrology and asttonomy used to be the same thing. The scientific aspect diverged and got renamed to astronomy to distance itself from the bullshit.
25	oml I’m so sorry OP for all that
4	Just goes to show it takes 0 skill to play that hero
26	The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
20	What happened?
21	It's got home made bread pudding so therefore the rest has to be good!
20	Me too, but unlike phones humans can „life“ without the other
7	Are your boys really doing the hand clap meme? Holy crap is this cringey.
20	There were people who knew about that before Vice. Not me, but people.
21	Just woke up from one. Glad to know it's not just me. Hope you have a good return!
20	You talk the talk without walking the walk. You cannot be a [NAME] and worship [NAME].
7	How are they significant? Israel does these exercises all the time?
20	Thank you!!! /s
21	I haven't watched the original FMA, but you're definitely in for a fun ride with Brotherhood. Hope you enjoy it!
2	Fuck you.
4	Unsurprisingly our closest competitors will try to capitalise as we stumble. Good luck to them, we have brought this on ourselves. 
26	Oh that's so sad
4	Sometimes it can be very expensive and can have a toll on mental health
26	This would make me sick.Getting cucked by bayern on and off the field.
20	Holy crap, what happened to that guy?
4	I’ll have to check that later, seems kinda weird if that’s the case
21	I think I will try to push through, I guess I can always drop a class or two if it’s too much and even take a break 
9	I missed that part unfortunately
13	Fucking happy this jerk is still well and alive.
0	Yepp, plenty of people like a nice big bush! I literally have no preference and think both are totally sexy.

1	Go to Happiest Hour before/after the game. Walking distance b/w AA center. It's a fun spot!
13	Oh man! Oh boy!
11	These are some of the lamest threatening letters I’ve ever seen. She’s a metahuman who can you murder people with her voice.
3	Yeah, a lot of people conveniently forget how devastating spacial apartheid was, and how permanent it's effects were designed to be.
3	You've added nothing to this conversation and just repeated what everybody else. Thanks for wasting my time.
13	Any [NAME] who are into this, hit me up! Love me some trance & techno. Can't wait for Transmission Sydney in March :)
4	I find Asian men hot and have dated a few - I'm a white woman
2	Conservatives now hate dancing... anybody surprised?
20	The person he marries is going to be murdered by him
2	Because idiots in this sub care too much about what other people have on their screen? It only tells me that too many people on here are narcissists.
21	I needed to hear this. I'm resigning my good paying FT soul sucking job to try something new. Wish me luck!
23	[NAME] was the [NAME] of the [NAME] years. Didn't realise he was still about.
20	Oop my bad
1	It's not as if she was my supervisor at bestbuy lol.
3	I think that's a reference to how fucking mad watching [NAME] makes people feel. ie shit [NAME] is playing and now I have the furies!
20	We try our hardest.
11	Even worse.
4	Wouldn't wipe my arse with it.
20	I think [NAME] was just holding back, who'd want to go kill their nephew ([NAME] in [NAME]).
20	I'm assuming they sense the change but to translate it onto the screen for the audience they have to have them realize it
7	I'm curious to see what his answer will be
11	Damn, 14 year olds in 2019 are bigger shits than I was when I was 14.
20	GDMNIT! Now I'm hungry!
20	Dude, if this was real you wouldn't have mentioned godfather. 
20	Therapy helps. If only to just talk and be able to process what has happened.
10	Then much of the advice here is terrible because it congratulates him on doing the entirely wrong thing.
20	This is the most pleasant debate I’ve ever had on reddit. Also, $nah$
20	This is getting out of hand! Now there’s two of them!

27	NL West had 3 teams in the playoffs in 2017 and 2 in 2018......wtf you on about
25	Oh, sorry! I clicked on your profile and thought you posted this in the BPD sub sorry 😅
24	I’m glad you fixed Minnesota, because there is a 0% chance we will go Red.
20	That's not justification to keep doing it. Also this would be the purview of the Democratic party since it's the primaries we're talking about.
13	*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)
20	You guys really hate the Seahawks more than the Cowboys? Maybe I'm just old.
15	Ah my apologies xir, did not mean to offend
20	We aren't even buying it's loans and still nobody has been signed
18	this is r/comedyheaven content alright. frick u i love it.
0	I just really don't see 20% for him. I would be very surprised.
0	you seem like the kind of person i’d like to be best friends with! :)
15	It was [NAME] thank you very much, than I'd go to wumpscut. 
20	She wants to be [NAME] so bad...
15	Agree. Keep trying, then if your rejected every time. I'm sorry your done.
20	Last time I saw was loooong ago. Basically before LN announced they went for probabilistic routing.
4	It actually depends. Do you have PCOS? Because if you do, then that would explain the change as well. 
20	I can't be down with chill. Give me intensity, or give me nothing.
4	Studying something doesn't make you bright. Getting a degree does.
20	"Edit your post and instead of it saying ""face...."" put ""book of faces"". I think thats why your post was removed."
4	[NAME] and [NAME] made their own beds with their own actions. But I agree with this too .
14	Crowder is terrible... How do you lose that gunfight or not have the common sense to just run away
20	Wish the blasters were more like BF1
1	Shit dude I thought I was Mr. [NAME]? Here have some beans lol
10	My biggest problem with Yuri on Ice is that it didn't have enough episodes to show the payoff of their relationship in my opinion.
24	My life is complete
20	Only good ones.
20	>[NAME] later admits to his brother he killed me ~~cause he hates bards~~ because he doesn't have the chops to run a robust encounter. FIFY
8	I want to downvote. But this sub is for stuff like this so I want to upvote. Man being part of interent hazmat is tough
12	I've always wondered how much of this stuff doesn't end up on the internet
20	Aren't reaction gifs *supposed* to be textless? The concept originates from imageboards after all
20	The chick that got out right before him literally said something along the lines of “what if the elevator starts and I get snapped in half” 🙄
0	Bat Out of Hell is awesome start to finish, I'd love to see a musical based on it.
0	He's the best [NAME].
1	Lol the guy in white who just leans back and looks away when he gets [NAME] ass in his face
4	You did it!
13	Hi [NAME] nice to see you
20	Ya know... a helmet never hurt anyone
18	I love how the dog bites hard enough to pull it away, but soft enough to not kill it
20	Here’s a little update lol so far I’ve had 3 matches today and all of them were “cam models” lmfao
12	Looks like I posted it. Oh no!
15	Thank [NAME] for the adult spammers on my susbscribed NSFW subreddits.
13	You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
0	Literally anything regarding [NAME] and her weird fans belongs here
20	6 and he died of cancer iirc
7	They'll investigate themselves and nothing will happen. Detroit police bully everyone. An they wonder why no one likes them, Respects them, Or why people run from them. 
14	Still waiting on [NAME] to tell me how GIFs are terrible and I can’t afford to watch anymore of them.
18	I also love the first sentence (but in a more pro-science way than was probably intended)
20	You too thirsty
20	[NAME] presses and holds b button (I feel you op)
10	You can't talk morality to psychopaths.
26	I was waiting for that but this isn't r/nononono or r/Holdmybeer
4	I know from personal experience that that can be the end of any good relationship.
4	Yes. Wait until recreational marijuana is legalised federally. Portugal could legalize all drugs including cocaine, but they are a small country.
20	In the Garden of Femininity, of course!
0	This is the most perfect , and fitting meme in this sub
6	All sounds possible except the key, I can't see how it was missed in the first search. 
20	Ok, for the low price of $27.97 I will help you out.
20	All the time here! Say have kid an ex wife and there poof gone!
4	Not gonna lie, I'd be intrigued for sure. 
6	I cant decide if replacing it with an icecream cone would make it better or worse or incredibly worse and also cursed
9	That's the biggest annoyance I have with this sub the past year; how little people value [NAME]. I don't get it.
20	Yep i always say this. Absolutely best case scenario is a foul ball. If he puts it in play it's probably a dribbler.
21	yeah, i believe thats the only moving part in the whole device.
0	[NAME] isn't really that bad, he's also a cheaper option who [NAME] trusts.
20	I'd prefer her as an actual character
7	Where did you get that? Highest I’ve found is Donagal at 23%.
21	That, but I also really think that [NAME] is going to be a top QB. Especially, if he progresses during his time as back up.
4	I'm just gonna take this as a metaphor for idiot units.
20	It's an mi5 threat to Ireland. Funny how [NAME] may wants to amend GFA the next day
2	Still an ad hominem and not a legitimate argument or counterpoint :)
7	Wow! What are the odds of that!?
15	no problem!!! :) have a great day, thanks for taking the time to comment
20	Same. Glad it's not just out store.
20	TAKE ME TO YOUR CRYPT, I WANT TO PAY MY RESPECTS!

4	They aren't wrong here in illinois. :(

20	For the last Time [NAME], YOU ARENT [NAME]
0	I am really sorry that you are feeling this way. Sending you good vibes and reminding you that you are beautiful.
23	And my apologies if I misinterpreted but you seemed to state multiple times that it keeps you from seeking other women, such as the [NAME] example.
20	Holy crap! A stunning play by mentally ill newcomer u/justforyouthlogic
20	As a biologist lol. What about hermaphrodites?
0	Much better 2nd quarter, keep it up guys.
11	No fuck that guy. I'm actually relived he was shot. Sounds like a sack of human garbage
10	[NAME] didn’t actively take any guns or accessories from me. [NAME] is... stop repeating circa 2012 Fox News propaganda to protect an active traitor.
20	Bench coming in strong. Let's go trey!
15	Sorry for all the questions I just find ASPD to be a fascinating disorder. I have BPD SO to me not having emotions sounds like a dream.
0	I know it's so amazing. Too bad all the people that hate the game haven't thought of giving it a try.
3	Test levels have been dropping significantly It’s well documented Why do you think that’s stupid
10	>They talked about it a lot in early 2017, specifically mentioning r/Minnesota. Lol, someone found one comment that had 3 points.
4	Sadly this is how you get shit fixed
20	Centrists compared to which left wing parties in other countries? Compared to the UK you guys are **far**-left.
9	i don’t need to see more good parents don’t treat their kids this way and bad parents will try to justify damaging behavior
20	I was my father's 4th girl. **Nothing** made him uncomfortable by that point
20	My partner told them subtly no thank you. They won't let go.
27	Wow. Have that much debit in your bovada account is something crazy. Props to you
2	Making DC climate an unapologetic brutality with blistering dry winds and no snow on a typical day.

0	He’s better than [NAME].
0	Thank you. I needed to hear all of this. I appreciate it.
1	So funny, I just watched this one today and was struck by [NAME] in the height of his coked out glory. He is absolutely so gross. 
7	So basically the union would be a legal fiction to simply elect federal representatives jointly and nothing else? Hmm. Anything more than that would be an implausible boondoggle.
20	Not a woosh but ok
10	says you, too bad you're totally wrong.
0	Hey, your hair looks great! As a fellow curly girl I'm just wondering what your routine looks like?
9	[NAME] has continued to show how selfish she is throughout the years..we shouldn't be surprised at this. [NAME] forbid she be the bigger person for the kids.
17	Yeah I was hoping for age 30+ stories, still interesting to hear other people’s experiences though!
3	I'm not to proud of them right now. I'm mad at them ☹☹ But big ups!!

20	I’m far to antisocial or have too much contempt for other people to do something like that
11	I remember the last protest we hid against these guys. Scum bags
23	It happened so fast I didn't even have time to be scared.
18	I love Kaep so much for those 2 playoff games alone.
26	I use them to lean against cause my lower back often hurts. But then again, any pillow could do that 
2	I’ve had to remove fallen trees on snowy roads because the forest service is not working as much. Shits a little fucked.
0	Great work hentaipoon!
7	Is he your source?
21	We can do this son. You don't want to miss [NAME] win his first Rumble and become the new top guy.
1	My bad lol.
1	Being compared to [NAME] is a compliment because he’s funnier than I’ll ever be soooo
4	No, treating it like it’s obligatory just means it’s a standard I have. People are allowed to have standards. 
3	I'll be rather upset if he scores against us
4	Yeah he stacked up some snow which is why he was laughing when the ref went to the bench
20	It took me a second to distinguish between whether it was [NAME] or [NAME]. I have officially been cursed by this subreddit.
13	wow, we really live in future
15	OK, I better understand the distinction you're making. Thanks.
5	The best role you can take to climb is shot caller. Give your team the information they're not aware of and they'll be more useful.

15	ah ok, thanks
8	"My husband and I are expecting a little boy. We will refuse to do the whole ""man up"" thing. No toxic masculinity here hopefully lol"

15	Thank you mate.
26	Sure, sorry for late response.
5	If it makes you feel better im gonna be scrubbing out hard for a while so maybe ill see you round to give me another loss
9	Don't let your high expectations of government disappoint you.

20	The SATs are taken on weekends, it's a standardized test that's used for university applications and not a regular school thing.
11	worst is when people with dogs think they know what it's like to be a parent omg like you dont even know YOU DONT EVEN KNOW

4	Anecdotally, I have severe hypothyroidism and it hasn't significantly affected my weight loss. The key for me was tackling the synthroid dose first.
7	I would really Like to know about the ride back
20	It'll definitely show our hand which means we will have to pay up to trade up high enough that we are sure we get Haskins.

20	I like to imagine that this is england in its entirety
20	Shouldn't have insulted chungus like that, if I see you in the fog you gon get facecamped

18	I love [NAME], but this sounds like he’s claiming signing a 26 year old superstar is stupid. Come on.

8	I wish I could too.
4	This is absolutely the proper place to post this.
9	What dose are you taking and how long did it take to help? I've been trying the Lazarus 50mg/ml. Not seeing any obvious improvement so far.

26	I miss [NAME] and [NAME]. :(

4	I know Bro! Won't happen again next Jan-uary.
4	Because most shit right wingers say is so awful that if they said it in a space where they weren't anonymous they would be fucking done
15	This really comforted me. Like genuinely. Thank you so much. You seem like a truly amazing person.
17	Which was in 2017. Enjoy your loss and shush. You'd think having 1 win in a month would humble you...

20	lol [NAME].
25	I sleep alone on the floor. That was a bad idea...

3	Cursed image.

19	I never even thought of that, just that it’s the most uncomfortable way to sit in a car, especially on the driver side! 
9	I don’t think people know how to use quotation marks
20	I haven't gone to someone to talk about it. I really want to, though. 
10	"ick! That makes me feel gross. I have ""Addison's Disease"". "
27	For [NAME] sake, they used OFFICIAL ones , my god. Fucking animals.
7	Is that good or bad?
0	"I workout to ""the grid"" a lot. It's a 20 minute piece that continually builds. Its wonderful."
20	(4) Fufill sexual pleasures
9	It does make sense... I've always had a hard time opening up and I'm worried that that's what's really been holding me back ultimately
0	That actually makes sense, thank you for answering my question. Did you try training your dog?
20	I tell them my wife died in a car accident 10 years ago and I couldn’t fall in love again. I’ve never been married.
27	lol since when do you have to go to a orientation?
0	Ideal situation. I just don't instead why fans are writing him off. He's a beast.
20	He’s actually a ghost. He died of that flu and his ghost is still cursed with the symptoms to this day.
1	Yeah that is the consensus I got for sure. Looking for a new place to live lol
4	It doesn't make you horny it just gives you a boner.
21	I'm yet to see the 2nd protect the rest of the constitution.
20	a partner of mine made it -- it's just about my favorite meme ever
18	I’d love to flatten [NAME] emotions.
0	Oh my. Bless this dog. He is a big boy. I love him so much. Tell him I love him.
20	Mine was apparently [NAME] and the giant peach!
10	He's just a money grabbing midget
2	Oh look, it's wr2! *proceeds to get fucked*
4	Thanks. And wow! Nice burn.
20	What happened that she was so pissed and did this live?
10	It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!
20	So are some women. A couple of my friends have this very issue.
20	Me too. :(
20	Cant you tell how sad she is from her face?
11	Thanks I hate it.
20	Tired of watching [NAME] choke, hope she's better in the deciding doubles 
9	[NAME] didn't finish the LPs!? Wow. I am in episode 20 something and was expecting him to finish :(
18	I think this is my favourite story of the year so far.
2	How can they tell if someone is a conservative? It's not like most of us go around wearing MAGA hats and Thomas Sowell patches on leather jackets.
10	I’m sorry, I’m my opinion it isn’t sweet. 
11	I thought for a moment the one mongoose was dead after watching the other one drag it.
0	I'm sure he immensely appreciates the gesture.
7	Wait isn't that the [NAME] from Fiver?
4	yes:)
0	Thank you. I hope things get better for you, and I believe in you, too.
23	Too hungry for that money.
13	All is well! Think I got one sorted out with one of her family members. Thanks for your help!
20	great for on the go! but i’ll always smoke glass if i’m home :)
18	Right. I’m surprised everyone thinks he’s so cute...
14	All of season 6 is terrible
0	Most of his overtly sexual posts give me that vibe...they seem exploitative and as just another way to prove he owns her
20	Omg I forgot which is good 🤮. This almost topped the steak in the butt cheeks. Almost ☝️
20	You're asking for scientific proof of spirituality. You're either very dumb, trolling, or you think I'm a charlatan.
4	Call it an ATATM (automatic teller ATM)
10	Judging from your post history, it's not a hard assumption to make. EDIT: Now to downvoting. [NAME] tier uberman playing 65D checkers with me
10	I guess some people just hate fun, lol
9	Oh no I didn’t see that episode!? She pooped in the car?!
14	I know. Maybe if they realize this, they'll stop using that app.
10	It shouldn't be, I feel like that's happened to us many times! 
0	This is my favorite game of all time. Thanks for bringing back some good memories!
21	[NAME] won it last year, even with all our goal kickers. Didn't think it would happen again with our set up.
20	Interesting note about the QR codes. I've almost never used them myself. I tend to just copy and paste an address.
3	I wouldn't be surprised if their confidence is so shot that they lose this control and lose 3-0
20	Losing to get draft picks doesn’t work as well as you think. A lot more goes into winning than getting a top 5 pick
4	I’m really starting to like that kid
25	He sounded so disappointed when he realized they just wanted sex :( Poor OP!
8	Could do even better by kicking out anything north of Cambridge or west of Oxford.
10	Unpopular opinion: I'd rather the team signed 26-year-old [NAME] over 30-year-old [NAME] coming off another leg injury.
27	Oh I know just bantz
20	Devils Advocate - Didn't the cringe-worthy Nike ad end up benefitting them in the long run?
23	If that’s not a joke it is a startling failure to notice one of the most interesting character arcs in the story
26	I'm in a similar boat, had surgery to correct Pectus Excavatum when in 2011, also 18 now, also deal with constant chronic pain.
3	The ridiculous hypocrisy of the far left has nothing to do with your link.
21	You can do it, I believe in you! 
20	It’s ok. We forgive you
21	Well hopefully we’ll find out how hard her life was tonight ☺️
20	[NAME] has an actual Fire Emblem channel and his fanbase plays Fire Emblem and Fire Emblem Heroes. That's a pretty big difference.
10	one quick glance at your comment history negates any value in this comment
23	I was about to explain that the one with 8 h's was taken until I read your username. Beautiful.
6	I don't know how accurate that is, pure nicotine is a lot different to nicotine in tobacco so I doubt vaping is that addictive
15	Yeah - we never had a fight. I'm glad we managed to end it in good terms. Thanks a lot for the sentiment, mate. Cheers!
20	with his luxurious salary, nice pension and zero accountability for anything it does, its a hard old life!!!
2	Is that because it's an accurate description of the politician and he's trying to distract from his guilt?
13	I've tried this and I chipped my tooth on the tiny fork cause I'm used to plastic lol!!! I'm a mess
21	......man Shes a decent candidate. But [NAME] is better. Well see. Lets hope for a legit primary.
3	Bigger kid in the black shirt perfectly missed the entire thing, turns back to see the kid pop back up and run away. Totally oblivious
15	Thank you for answering me, I did ask him Straight forward but he just told me is busy 
23	You know it wasn't missionary, if she wanted it that bad she was most likely doing all the work.
4	You are normal. Very normal.
26	Someone will actually spend their money on this too, that’s the sad part
1	Actually looks really fucking fun. Where can I do this?
20	Show down there heretic. You obviously meant to say: Unquestionable truth, any diversion from what seems to be true only comes from our own limitations. /s
20	Not very choosing beggars-ish, but definitely entitled parents material. Did she really just say that to you? Cuz you can call her out for verbal assault.
3	"She also spoke out quite angrily about ""Obamacare"" until she needed it due to her high risk pregnancy. She's remarkably hypocritical."
20	Don't wo
4	Yes he knew the child was his. I was living with him the entire time and we were constantly together.
26	I've got no place else to go...
4	Start an initiative to take away cops guns since you feel so strongly about it
15	They seem to be about 1/2 the price anyone else has quoted me, so it`s a good place to start, thank you!
20	inertial frame of reference is the viewing party.
15	Lol this was cosmetic. Thankfully both of mine are alive and well.
2	SO FAR I couldn’t even listen to all of zombie bastards and ckth was mediocre
0	Booty matters MUCH more in my opinion
0	I would love to see an [NAME] cosplay!

4	As long as I have my plasma rifle and some combat armour, I think I can traverse the wastes without a ride just fine.

13	*wrap* happy birthday
10	It's not his job to train you.
5	Stay strong friend.
26	r/UpLiftingNews Edit: I just got banned for posting this there.
8	Honestly don't know why they are still working so hard on this trade, really need another starter.
11	I tried to quit smoking it only lasted 1 month but nofap I did for almost 2 years
17	[NAME] damn, that is the kind of biting commentary I enjoy.
0	Amazing. Perfect ending.
20	Gotta think [NAME] was also tired after all the hard work they put out Most likely it'd be easier for a fresh player to run passed players
20	Oh man, dream date right there. Zoo then sushi?? Yes please. 
20	Even in Star Trek they have $, they just dont really talk about it. The point is basic needs are so trivial
27	No, he said he's bringing in somewhere around 10K a month, not 2500 a month. That's a HUGE income gap.
4	Former HUD secretary? I'll bet he'd make a hell of a brain surgeon.
12	Whoops!! I totally didn’t realize ‍♀️
4	yes it does.
9	whah we got a badass over here xD
26	Another bad essay by me, sorry for butchering anarchism, anti-ableism and anti-psychiatry but I hope I got the point across :p
23	Yeah it isn't the same singer. 'Don't hug me I'm scared' is voiced by [NAME], the lead singer of KKB is [NAME]
4	I guessed that but I’ve never seen a bun like that
26	Awe, poor baby. 
25	Well unless you have an audio recording, people are gonna struggle to diagnose it for you any further I’m sorry. 
20	But he did...at the end of last year and this season.... And I’ll take Mayfields word over speculation
6	What? I am aware it isn't permanent. The other legals aren't permanent either.
23	I didn't realize there was ever an initial post on this subject.
20	Now she just needs to put start stealing hams and then if they ask she can show her stump and she will get away with it
20	this guy is such a douchebag
13	"With the up and coming hit single ""I have a new Daddy every week""."
20	Hmmmm this is so familiar but I can't quite put my finger on DJEEEOOOWWWOBRRRRBRBRBRRGRRRRRRDRRRRRRJRHRRJRRERHRJRGRHRRJRHRHRBRJ
23	Huh... I'm left handed and have never realised I do this.

18	wtf i love basketball again.
3	I have the same issue with a new co-worker and it drives me insane.
1	I wish I could get this kind of funny stuff sent to me on Snapchat. All I ever get are bobs and vagene.
20	(slow claps) Well played!
6	Who would have guessed Libertine Gold and Black posters would be coke heads?
3	I ain’t your pal buddy.
15	Figured since [NAME] is expiring and you guys are tanking it didn’t really matter
25	For real though, I do apologize. That's a bad run of luck for sure, it's such a rare syndrome 
6	Do you still have the video?
7	"[NAME]: ""Wait a minute? You're on my list!"" [NAME]: ""What a coincidence, you're on mine too."""

11	FINISH ON HER!! Seems way more appropriate for a sex doll
4	Yep, and because you do, you’re going on the highway to hell
20	If [NAME] gets the better of [NAME] today, EV should learn not to start [NAME] at RB against pacy attackers m 
20	Really? I thought he hated Mou.
20	That can be true...
20	Boooo!!
20	I do have a feeling [NAME] will retire while [NAME] still has a season on his contract.
11	It has little to do with experience, to be human is to err.

20	This reminds me of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas!
1	Omg lala a housewife I can’t even imagine!
20	You know I’m not the only one that stole a meme and posted it in other subreddit, right? 
11	Shh don't spoil it for us

20	To piss people off probably
0	my first thought was Superstar!
20	We should build a pipeline! Oh wait...

4	yeah. many people mentioned that. also Shield Brah questions beastmen racism .
4	Also here's my starting point on the right, obviously, for my bulk.
20	Then, why include any indication of gender or sex at all?
1	I read that whole thing, so damn funny. But seriously, all those guys need to be sterilized.
18	it looks like she took it in a totally different direction which i’m loving
20	Had one of those in Penticton when I was a kid too.
10	Bishop [NAME] was talking about lawmakers rather than the women who seek abortions. Though the situation doesn't matter when it comes to dismembering a baby.
20	Except trophy hunters, although take away their gun and see how well they fare then.
5	My comment wasn't aimed at you... try to relax
8	I want to be a rapper. I also like to write poetry and stuff. So to be successful with those things also I want to design clothing.
20	See my post about Ohio above. Not as bad as you think.
0	Good luck with your short

9	I'm literally in tears right now. Everything you said is true oh my godddddddddddddd.

25	They're corrupt, but in the legal ways.
6	I desperately want to believe you but then
17	Maybe you need some time get loss of that thought. Try to ignore it and just enjoy your luck.
21	Ha interesting. Grew up in MN and never thought about this.
20	Do you always assign people positions they don't hold to avoid accountability for being a failure? Or is this a recent development?
20	And what do you find in the mist in subnautica crystalized sulfur. So I believe this is definitely what they modeled the lost River after baddabang
20	Can you believe it girls? [NAME]: 9 months ago I was in jail and now I'm a cabaret star

23	Was not aware. I know it's bad but I rather keep my head in the sand on this one because I still want to like [NAME].

27	Noooo. I seriously did not know that. Yes, mind blown. 
0	I love Wood Witch, still saving to buy that.

6	I probably should have seen that... I watched it without sound, and just thought the guy was drunk.. 
26	I was tested for the flu on Saturday and it came back negative, but yea it probably is a cold or something

1	You keep turning it into all or nothing lol I said *less* bookshelves will be made if *more* bookshelves are reused
5	100% feel for you. I may be exaggerating slightly but still it’s all these little disadvantages that we get put at because of this ping.
27	I'm so surprised they haven't done it yet tbh!
15	Hey [NAME], just wanted to say thanks for coming to Minnesota, that’s all :) 
21	Texas, I'm really just mad at myself for not double checking. But now I have a year to find something better
0	Wow such a story! This is great art. Can I find more stuff like this somewhere?
2	This sub is a fever dream
20	I have an idea. Hear me out in this. Maybe we shouldn’t get upset about [NAME] until.... they...sign... elsewhere? Too radical?
20	The IW writers didnt want him to get out of it and the plot felt extremely rushed.

3	Wiggs stop that thing you do with your tongue man.
3	"> He never actually said anything about spam He said in his video ""Take this profile picture and spam comments like oh y y"" on all videos"
20	Wrong, it's not 365 days a year. Once every four years, it's 366 days a year.
7	It's definitely not that simple mate! It would be nice if it were. Where's the part about inflating your way out of trouble for example?
5	Uh eat less than you burn per day. Eat a lot of protein.

23	I think the flairs get removed if a team hasn't been to a major in a certain amount of time. Don't quote me on that though.
23	[NAME] won it last year, even with all our goal kickers. Didn't think it would happen again with our set up.
4	Emotes have a ridiculous amount of effort put into them, which only makes the fact that nobody uses them sadder
23	Most of the people on top aren't even very relevant anymore, at least not nearly as relevant as they used to be
9	In all honesty no slip shoes do actually prevent slips like 99% of the time. This guy just seems to be the unlucky minority.
20	I can feel his cheeks puffing out.
17	Happy New Year! Let's smash 2019!
20	[NAME] was quite anti-Semitic.
21	You were really fortunate! See, that’s what I imagined would happen... 
5	Be safe.

8	[NAME] I wish that were me
20	A mod like this, especially if it's exclusive to your servers, would be full no matter what
1	Ah, the frigid winds of teen rebellion...
9	I’m broke as shit and already do that.
20	I'd rather take the chance that a kind, helpful comment falls on deaf ears than a snide one ends up hurting someone. 
10	I really can't remember the last time my mind was this blown by an OP on this sub, and that's saying a lot.
9	I literally didn’t but ok
17	So, [NAME] was also paying to allow her to eat healthier. Let’s look at the bright side! 
11	Stars don’t get chicks my dude. Good way to let everyone know you are a fucking goober

13	Goddamn I’m excited about this football team!
6	Wow, now that you say that . Although, we do have [NAME], South Park, Family Guy and American Dad now. Mmmmm, [NAME] 
10	Seriously, way to miss the point. Even if no liquid falls from their eyes, they suffer immensely.
10	First season got a lot of attention. I didn’t like the second season as much
4	I can totally see it. I’d be very interested to see them interact.
3	You cant love this girl if she already has a GF whom she sounds like she loves. You'll just ruin a relationship

0	excuse me what. [NAME] played midfield pretty much the entire half of last season for Liverpool
15	Thanks mate. I'm going to repeat your words to myself until I start believing them. Thanks for giving me a bit of hope :)

3	Oh [NAME], dont talk about clippers!
3	Hey now, don’t try to have the guy killed. This is an upstanding sub. 
10	Yknow that is one of the main reasons farmers have a lot of kids right? Cheap labor.
20	So, now that his chance of being PM is slipping away, he's going full [NAME] and invoking conspiracy theories. The man is scum.
20	What's bigger meaning? Dude is horny, dude gets laid. Pretty simple.

3	slander? it's only slander if it's untrue, and all I said was that you don't grasp satire, which is obviously true.
15	Thank you. Let’s not blame one parent only for the existence of a child, or the batshitness of one coparent.

10	The power dynamics argument is one of the most ridiculous arguments ever - unless it’s someone who has a *direct* influence on your life or outcomes.
4	So long as we get the [NAME] from this season and not last season I'm happy
20	Now that you put it that way I can’t un-see it.
27	Does anyone notice how his voice always changes when he’s trying to be cute and charming.
4	I support the idea of punishing [NAME] without trying to injure [NAME].
17	Pressure 7 targets/10 targets, popcorn, any tracking, and any tile frenzy because I enjoy trying to beat my highscore

20	But that situation is not really what you are talking about, is it?
20	They should all be virgins until they're old enough to consent. Obviously this applies to both genders just like drinking laws.
7	[NAME] will love [NAME]. I wonder what the deal will look like if it happens.
20	Since she ate other food I would guess it is a way of getting around a digestive disorder or carbs.
2	My wife would say that all of the above and another dozen more are cheating...and she wonders why I’ve fucked other women...
6	Ok you're a little homophobic

0	I love adamtots. He's a great comic creator
5	This is your first boyfriend so you're overanalyzing more than you normally would. It's your issue you just have to move past it.
4	Yessir, it gives me the creeps. That boy ain't in Scotland, and that boy ain't right.
21	Seriously. A lot of small businesses especially rely on federal work. I hope this gets solved soon.
7	wouldn't you say [NAME] and [NAME] are part of the same generation?
2	I hate that this is true. Some of these offices are such a pain to find and cash tips are never part of the equation

7	You know he humps the hell out of that thing right? Like probably right in [NAME] mouth!

6	As bad in what ways? The rest of who? Other politicians?
20	Damn, I thought she was calling her as ugly as a dog and said she would take her out for a walk. I like my version better.

4	Now it just looks like she has a cape...
20	Removed. Rule 4.

1	Gotta cheat on taxes somehow LOL
4	Pretend it's a multiplication table. Memorize a bit at a time.
5	The Supreme Court has already ruled the police have no obligation to protect you. They are there to enforce laws.

3	Just split for gods sake before kids are born.
15	I love your comment...
0	I think [NAME] said it best. When two people watch the same video and see completely different events....there's no fixing that.

15	Thanks, this means a lot! I will do don't worry :)
0	Well done dude! Seriously :) But keep it up, don't lose this momentum.
20	Fried Egg is my #1 since cricket cafe stopped doing breakfast sandwiches.
3	Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he’s only now feeling the consequences of his actions
7	What is it again?
20	I work on a farm. I can confirm can be dangerous. I have a hard time imagining a scenario where being a cop is more dangerous.
20	Looks deliriously boring.
17	I like to believe he faked his own death, so he can enjoy his many Bitcoin coins and wealth.

8	I feel like I say this a lot but I wish we'd run the mudiay frank back court more, I like their chemistry together
1	Remember they are an ex for a reason. Seeing that smile probably made you remember all the happy times
7	How is the JC-01 with juul pods. I've heard mixed reviews.
20	Odd to think that most people in this photo are either dead or just about into pension age.
4	I schedule reading breaks during the day. It allows me time to relax if I’m feeling overwhelmed, but is still beneficial for the kids. 
23	Oh, did you not know [NAME] is the highest graded overall passrusher in this class? At any position!
17	Lucky for me the yellow ones are my favourite
20	I mean, sharing is caring and momma wants her cummies.

20	Name and shame
3	Well yeah, you've gotta paint it white yourselves
13	Wow, automated can collection is news in 2019? Literally have done this for a decade minimum...
3	I can't help but agree with the headline at the bottom, bright side (the YouTube channel) is annoying.

4	I see. Never get bored is my main goal :)
1	😅 sorry. Lol
2	Stop using your corporate jargon around here!
0	Looks like goodfellow
26	Uh, sorry. We're under trumpcare now.
