20	I think there was a reason, there was for me. I saw her as far too power-hungry and completely full of herself.
18	I loved ScienceBowl and KnowledgeBowl in highs school. Wish we had a college bowl.
0	at least you found it
20	cant wait for their collective breakdown if she goes home
4	As someone who just drunkenly told his boss what everyone else said about him behind his back, I can agree. 
15	Glad to hear this. Thank you.
0	Woooooooahahhohohohohho nice one Bembry to [NAME].
0	Damn, good thing I got those experts to tell me that, I'd never have guessed!
10	So, they want a more profitable split? Surprised they wouldn't go for the Discord store then. Didn't it offer even better a split?
27	Oh yeah? Come back when you drop your stew on the floor before eating any.
1	The thought that the armed forces of the US unironically use it is hilarious.
2	I completely agree with you just the whole mood against abortion gets my blood boiling.
20	the one who doesn't move except to back down any wannabe who's been talking that trash to him
20	Probably out of desperation as they going no answers with the other made up god.
2	I was kicked, and apparently don't care about oversharing on Reddit about it anymore
20	Suddenly, Dorion will fleece another GM of their 1st pick for [NAME] ? Not a chance.
4	My grandpa does drive this way.
20	Hiya! 😃
20	The Russian goal is division. You know, the exact sort of division these people are willingly participating in.
5	The fact that you stayed this long really doesn’t but the blame on him, you chose this relationship 
20	Hes literally making 15 an hour
1	I laughed in my beard.
6	[NAME] doesn't even look that big here. But he's still handsome.
1	No. EDIT: Shoutout to the fat nerd who downvoted every comment in this thread just because we don’t stan the dancing games lmao
23	Okay, carry on then. Just thought I’d make sure you recognized that there was a difference.
4	The only thing I know is that none of us don't know anything
7	Wait so you can get an acre of rainforest for $35? I mean, it would be way cheaper at that volume but still that's real cheap
0	maybe. Id praise her for it though. In a world of... instagram beauty... its refreshing when someone is just themselves
20	[NAME] having a horrible night
1	Lol, try harder next time bud. Your swearing really shows who is actually mad here and your stupidity is starting to get really grating.
12	I just realized people in apartments are essentially screwed, that is too bad man, hopefully you'll get that going soon! It's worth it!
20	Have you received any answers from them outside of ‘DM me your client ID’ and ‘please make a support ticket’?
20	Boy, she really does live rent free in your heads. At least conservative head rent is cheaper than D. C. rent. 
25	Idk about that, but if you were being genuine I apologize. I just don't think that is the case in this situation.
20	Oh don't worry, their kids were taken away. 
6	If she was in that mode, why would this guy even be in consideration for a Super Bowl date? 
20	Hahah I do live in Montreal, and you’re right. [NAME] damn it has been cold this week. 
22	He actually did, couldn't believe it.
15	Thanks! Need to rewatch the series soon
2	Why you mad bro
9	Oh getting down voats. The EU fascists don't like it when you speak out against the 4th Reich.
15	Wow thanks. Didn’t know there were any others glad to hear
4	This is the proper timing
4	Yes, he did. 
20	Improvise. Adapt. Overcome
26	you should have asked this question 15 years ago sadly :(
4	>Apple convienently provided an adapter. If they left the headphone jack, why couldn't I just use an aux cord?
15	Thank you!!!!!
7	Mr. Krabs?
20	Honestly if they were so worried about the tube, it’s possible to keep it safe with dressings etc over the tube site.
10	"This is why the option isn't ""be accurate"" but ""be as accurate as you can"""
20	Any man who won’t fight for his kids isn’t worth your time.
23	Sorry, I live in the real world. Just because you don't like facts doesn't mean they don't exist.
20	You are. And so am I.
5	I'm out of my past issues in many ways; thank you for the concern. What is one without their vices
10	31/M/I don’t know, I’m blind.
10	He didn't run off like a deadbeat when he thought the kids were his.
4	I’ve tried a few times on mobile and it never works for some reason. Edit: just logged on at work and fixed it. Feels good
1	Awesome. Glad to hear it
3	Justice for that horrendous no call
12	sorry mr brolobo
4	Damn... that’s another thing I didn’t even think about it. Probably the biggest reason why people shouldn’t steal food
10	i've never been baby crazy but goddamn if i'm not always craving an adorable puppy in my arms 😭😭
5	You know the answer man, you are programmed to capture those codes they send you, don’t avoid them!
4	Is that supposed to be outrageous? Assuming he met the requirements and earned them all, good on the guy for planning for his future.
1	Lolz yeah you got me for sure. That's another huge reason.
1	Even then, the commentor could have gotten the joke and was just being dead pan. 
0	Ah, pillars of society. No wonder MLS is so highly regarded.
23	Without the skill, or body, like seriously, not to sound badass, but I'm 14 and look bigger than this [NAME] wannabe 
20	Your mom did you a favor; now there is one less of “us kids” that will be buying mom a house and taking care of her.
2	When your dog dies, you will realize how absurd this statement is.
20	I’m sure mueller was stumped on this until he hopped on reddit and saw this sound advice
20	I dont get into politics much but if they want to echo chamber leave them alone it wont change them they will only get more angry

7	Did you see it with [NAME]? I don’t see him have chemistry with anyone
10	Its not exactly what I thought it was gonna be either, but its okay, there's a lot of food.
20	And I for one welcome our new meme overlords.
20	No. That's something you can't prove unlike American support to KCK.

20	Alot more common in NY City.
15	Looks sooooo good~
3	Same my dance card is completely full. I'm looking at a big pile of snow, I couldn't possibly fit that in. 
15	I stand fully corrected, thank you!
20	When I was a young warthog!
20	How so. What is the basis for your feeling of universal entitlement?
2	Oh fuck off already.
27	Like... how is that possible? Holy shit
13	Not sure, but if so that is unfortunate. I really liked their cheese bomb deep dish. =[
17	I am glad, and enjoy. It has some pretty cool theological discussions.
20	This not the first or second mistake by VAR against us.There was even an wrong offside against us some games ago and they didn't checked it.
20	Say bye bye to your vas deferens and hello to your ex.

1	I don't even understand stuff is going on, I just laugh and hope it's at the right time. 
0	Maybe some people are just lucky to have an amazing connection to [NAME]
3	Outrage over something that isnt even true. Thats sad man Edit: well the bandwaggoning part is true
6	I had no idea! The art style just seemed similar to me. Looks like I’ve got a new show to watch.
7	"Upset? Edit. I didn't notice anybody bring it up but I hope it isn't rude to describe [NAME] being ""Yandere""."
18	Bruh, I’ve been getting this tough love since I was 18. Hence the dusty balls. 
18	[NAME] is my top choice. Love the tape and could anchor the line for many years
7	Do you smoke? Smell strongly? Have dirty boots?
27	OHHHHH! THAT ONE! Oh, *[NAME]*... 
18	Really? I’m not so sure, because I really do like her a lot.
17	But what if that's the only job I would enjoy?
20	lol at them both getting downvotes
26	Yeah that's how someone died at Dour festival when swimming in the stone quarry :/
2	please stop pointing your fingers in my face
6	What do you mean by delicate flowers?
21	Well you wrote out this big comment, and it reads well but when you actually think about what you’ve said, IMO it really means nothing.
22	That’s pretty damn good
25	When we have tens of millions starving or dying of thirst, at least you will still have the moral 'high ground'.
0	I’m so glad I watched this entire thing. That’s incredible.

3	I feel these people think, what you think you can just feel good? They always feel bad so should you.
4	You just need to live your best life. Do the things that make you happy and don't dwell on any of the negatives.
20	"[NAME] to [NAME]: ""Don't try and tell me how to defend"""
20	But did you see my friend sent me a picture of [NAME] trying to tell me he's having a baby
4	Nobody forced [NAME] to take [NAME] over [NAME], if he liked him that much then he should’ve just taken him.

12	Whoops! My mistake
0	He was the best hitter in baseball 2017 ST. That's not a joke. What happened since is a few things, but he was.
15	I feel like that's what they both deserve, though. Thank you for the support <3
20	Now figure out how to grow bunches like that.

2	I bet if anyone else had his condition without being a Veteran would have served some sort of punishment.
20	This submission was removed for breaking rule 7. This topic has already been posted, please search.

10	Now THIS IS shitposting
10	In this view, you claim to wield power over them, and are clearly no anarchist. You are implicitly advocating for hierarchy.
17	Happy Cake Day [NAME]! Enjoy this slice on me 🍰

18	[NAME], I love these kinds of threads.

20	Almost heaven, West Virginia!
20	[NAME] weapon is gambol shroud but I nearly forgot about the gunchucks they are pretty rad too
3	You're the reason [NAME] won the election. There isn't anything even remotely resembling fascism in the United States. Get a grip.

17	Yesterday I remembered that this game existed and was happy that I waited and didn't buy into a game that would be dead in a month.
18	That is some serious dedication... He must love his job
20	She does't even go here
27	"Without seeing the rest, it's entirely possible he's right. ""Everyone on reddit thinks it's true"" isn't terribly compelling."

20	They'd probably just use it to buy up armies and navies for tyrants who oppress and reign with blood and horror or some shit.
26	Even [NAME] got sick of grunge
20	I feel like anytime a store accepts crypto is a way to get out of reporting income on taxes heh.

3	yes but you will look like you've never lifted a day in your life without a pump
27	But there's supposed to be only one survivor, and they win the million dollar prize!
20	Yeah I doubt the woman would post about it whilst still in his bed. She'd wait until she was dumped then complain about it at least.

10	That's a lot of assumptions. My local post is exceedingly lazy.

23	Oooo I see, I was hoping it wasn't a troll thing, it seemed really tasteless.
3	It's not unique and its decidedly worse.
27	Definitely surprised we took out [NAME] there. We needed to finish the quarter strong and it went straight to shit when he left.
5	Avoid. Without a contract he can kick you out at short notice any time And when you pay a deposit make sure it's protected.
15	I really hope you do this for a living. Thanks!
20	[NAME] nerds thinking they are cool by assigning some bullshit fantasy words to error messages...theater mode is probably just acting up

0	1. Well said. 2. I like your style. 3. Prove it.
6	Or maybe it was because the government can't collect the tax on it
20	Keep yer grubby paws off our Dlo.
0	But it looks so cute
12	I was won against an ultra-hard brexiteer, he tried to hit me with an uppercut but I just teleported behind him.
9	Sorry, might have been the wrong command. Just checked my uplay for it. It's /nodinputpad
15	Thank you...
3	You have no legs to stand on to accuse me of such.
8	This sub needs more Poison memes.
7	Does this remind anyone else of the Rublev USO17 QF? [NAME] is obviously further along than [NAME] but you can't argue against the results...
20	He also stepped in when seabs got suspended in the 2014 playoffs
15	Thank you!
4	Lol for real tho. But hey, we’re a football, soccer, and tennis school now
2	As ~~a very attractive person~~ an animal lover Monkey Heart sounds kind of cute to me, too bad these racist people use it as an insult
20	Name something just pick a single thing so I can present evidence to you .. quit sealioning
14	I was/am the same. I'm the one pushing forward with the divorce though. The feelings of loss and fear are overwhelming sometimes though.
20	I honestly couldn’t care less about your opinion at this point
18	> ftw Awesome statistic. Made my day! Love it
1	lol you are 18 and a female. You'll surely find someone
4	***Ni***🅱🅱🅰, ***FRITOS***. I swear to FSM that *this girl* is 25% frito.
20	Seriously!? Wouldn't a guy do the same thing if a girl didn't even attempt to get him off?
3	How offensive. I, am NOT a duck!
10	Something's wrong. The top post on r/conspiracy isn't completely anti-conspiracy? Wow, feels weird. /s(?)
25	Sorry [NAME] is our best friend now
10	False, if I'm close to the cart return I can't run and ride the cart back to the return. Lol
4	That’s nice. If you know anything about Nazi history, you know the party made its platform up on the fly. 
20	[NAME]’ column the other day had an interesting line, “zealotry is often people working out their psychological wounds.”
20	More like hold my cane
10	The dense stuff isn't very accessible. :/
4	Yep. Tough week for [NAME]. Not shooting well, first ejection and fine, ripping out jerseys, first triple double and the DSJ drama. 
14	First I was afraid, I was petrified...
21	Will do. Have a good night man.
20	It got tired
9	*Lente, otherwise a great song. Theme song to my varsity years 
20	Oh, [NAME]... [INSERT SITCOM LAUGH TRACK HERE]
4	I agree totally. Talk about fucking insanely bizarre. He's stuck in the shining
20	Refusing to acknowledge the *'First Act of Supremacy (1534)'* was a reason too.
2	They took my favorite hair gel!! The bastards! Good thing I took a picture of it beforehand just in case
4	Very true that is why I'd also reccomend a mod tweaking AI. Ofcourse the dev's should've done this all themselves but alas.
20	I like [NAME] but I disagree with him here. Then again it's not much surprise that a mega rich globetrotter that lives next to [NAME] would hold such views.
4	Definitely accurate, lasted about a month total in a Disney “internship” program... was more like slavery. Terrible experience that ruined Disney for me
20	Both but which one being the most used isn't really important.
2	"I would pay money for [NAME] to not be my nurse. She will probably ""accudentally"" squeeze my nuts. Crazy bitch."
20	Oh that’s crazy to expect that much. 10/5 years is nothing.
6	Maybe the abandonment of his mother. Some people won’t see that as abusive but it really is.
4	Fine, you're right, they should just have a random fascist activist.
17	Downtown is inconvenient, look like you've gone full county, enjoy your strip mall 
20	Ride in trunk
3	A machine would literally do a worse job than him.
20	[NAME] back too please. It's like [NAME] summoning the nazguls to retrieve the ring/stop 10IAR.
20	Yeah that's not almost a semi auto. And the slam fire is vastly over rated.
0	"Super petty. The story makes you sound pretty jealous and controlling, as well. Especially the ""SJW"" line... It sounds like a 16-year-old incel. "
15	You literally changed someone's life for the better. You made the world a better place. Thank you for helping change the stigma against autism.
3	I can't stop trying to parse it. Lick (my) azz; lick Ms. [NAME]) azz; Chevy('s) lick azz.
2	I would literally rather have the government throw $3k into a shredder than fund this shithead’s trip down south
4	I'm sure she values you more than money. At least give talking to her a chance before you do this, you should explore your options before committing
20	school is not that bad
0	Interesting situation. You're actually supporting a strong awesome woman, but everyone who sees you is just gonna think you're a misogynistic psycho.
5	Must be a nice feeling...unless UDG is counted.
14	That's a hot pic Shame she'll kill us all
2	The anniversary march was held in Derry Sunday past , not one mention on BBC itv not a thing. 14 people murdered in cold blood. Nothing.
6	If she's making inapropriate claims thats a problem too, Im not exactly sure what your point is?
23	I said that weeks ago
18	In the USA you won’t disappear for badmouthing the USA. That’s what I love about it.
26	Sorry for your loss. My bestfriend is turning 13 soon and I'm trying to cherish every minute we still have.
0	I'm on board the Saints hype train. [NAME] is an amazing QB.
4	I mean...that’s quite obvious. I’m just left wondering what the other item is. 2/10
20	I like how in the wrapped version, [NAME] looks like he is hiding a chub.
20	dude, you need a some sun on those damn things you call legs. 
20	But, for the time being, its hilarious.
15	Thank you. This is well-written and it’s really helpful.
10	See i hate [NAME] and got my ass kicked that game bc i couldnt use him so i was lime why me 😂
20	They need to practice intuitive feeling and depression acceptance.
1	Wow the garbage one and the bank one are really terrible. I’ve had the coupon ones too, people are touchy about coupons haha.
26	OMG, crying laughing right now. Hubs and I both. What a visual!
1	Oh dear, you are entertaining. Please, talk more to me. 
18	I like how nobody else is doing anything to stop him
4	Love the post bro. Gave me a lot of ideas.
27	Wow did you really just scam me😔
20	You will give her your arm and next day she you will give you the cold shoulder. Please just run!
0	That'd be amazing! Heard about Newington's reno not long ago. Need to get over there.
21	My meme coins are starting to hit the 70% growth range from the beginning of the month. I'm feeling bullish.
18	[NAME], I love science.
20	Only fair - although they they could have reported it as 0-0 since ND never showed up.
10	How does that mean his brain is in my mouth, even when I used to work with a shotgun...
26	No I’m just following your logic. To avoid pain people should die. Life is pain so people in pain should die. It’s your exact logic
3	Idk why but your comment in particular made me audibly crack tf up
9	What's wrong with that? [NAME] scandal is funny but not something to focus on in 2020.
20	Story of my life.
20	Down to 4 defencemen including pouliot. So really 3 defencemen and a pile of garbage.
15	Race idealists are ridiculous.
20	XD
3	Oh for fuck sake. Things were going so well on the coaching front. This dude is nothing but a suck up
20	There's literally nothing wrong with it except you being worried about the purity of your partner like c'mon.
4	Please don’t give up like that. People gaslight you, and you just lie down and take it? You are stronger than that. 💕
5	Think about it as a normal match then be confident in your play.
23	I've realized after more than 100 hours that you can dismount a horse without jumping off
11	Dear lord this woman is awful
1	that's adorable asf
23	The comments made by [NAME] to Truth on Smackdown about [NAME] makes me really think [NAME] has an outside chance at the win
26	This is so sad. #playdespacito
21	Just got done reading that part. Even [NAME] saw it in her dream and she never knows shit.
9	I'm expressing my distaste at the absurdity of being an internet outrage hero and hypocritical selective outrage, especially in an area such as black music.
20	the dude wanted to watch the talking car show. geez. haha jk. thats freaking creepy
2	yes, i fucking hate that.
9	Memes that were made 2 or more years ago don’t count. They were probably funny back then, just not now.
9	What's with the buying porn thing? I missed out on it
13	Can I start getting excited for [NAME] yet
26	I can't believe he told that story. I'm sure the minister that released the water is now so totally regretting not asking for a bj!
26	I hope all my muscles cringe so spastically all my joints come loose and I collapse into a writhing agonized pile of blood and meat.
13	Gotcha, thanks for the reply. I know about the emulator ones, just wasn’t sure if any had been ported
21	It's time to cultivate some mass.
4	I'm replying just bask in the glow with someone else! Yay!!
3	"They don't even have to do ""both sides,"" just the truth!"
20	[NAME] isn't advocating socialism. He's advocating the government intervene in the labor market because those mean free marketers. Not [NAME] but populist left
1	Ahah! I bring tidings of good news for you friend, [NAME] has heard our cries and is WELL AWARE of our desires for Co op
4	My mother did this. This isn't just a millennial thing.
20	Probably end of February and all of March before release. I think that's what they did last year
13	If I were him, I would have made sure to fall HARD the second the first officer touched me. Congrats, you're getting paid kid. 
7	You really are this stupid aren’t you? Whatever buddy I don’t argue spastics.
14	What’s the clip from? I’m scared to put “teen boy good kisser 900 number” into YouTube
9	This literally broke my heart
4	I agree that you need more time in the later turns. But most games it feels like people wait until it is their turn to start thinking.
26	I see notifications of people commenting the source but this sub must auto delete or something. Sorry, guys. I binged her and found me quick though. 
14	I thought that type of camouflage failed horribly because the high contrast and defined shapes made the ships really stand out.
15	Right... so true. I’m sorry you’re going through this too.
20	He has a girlfriend. Unfortunately she is not thick. He needs to take a page out of [NAME] book.
12	2. I hate to say it but it’s the same thing I do and I hate myself for it
20	His name has already been released. Just can't post it here.
3	Yes, when I need to get my jush, it’s freaking epic.
20	Not that poster, but huh, 
2	This is some of the worst passing I've ever seen.
20	That’s just proof positive they aren’t meant to be.
7	My goal for the year is to delve deeper into GTO related play and how to better understand how to use that to play better myself and against others
4	Definitely, I'd do that. The league pass deal isn't awful though.
7	yeah but we really don’t want to be like them. it is an example of failed communism turned militaristic authoritarianism
1	LOL I read that and slavated. I wish we could pull that sweet of a deal off.
17	Lol this never gets old
17	You were used as a weapon to inflict pain on your father. Glad you reconnected and found a good parent.
20	There goes my hero....
18	That's sick I love your setup! Have a great tour bud!
20	That's what I heard coming into this game, people were saying if they don't handle gobert, game over
7	Does she not know how cups work?
20	Waddle like your life depends on it because it might. Ice is dangerous.
3	[NAME] fucking [NAME], that man is enormous.
3	Quit talking about politics.
4	Woah up until this comment I thought the same
7	Did the words get unbanned?!
2	Worse. They told us to mind our own business
20	[NAME] advisors did the same.
20	Even if she was 25 this would have been weird and creepy af.
20	Can i give reddit gold to your sister... Or at least a gold star Also how was the show
20	RemindMe! 3 months
10	Looks like pretty much any Donkeys fan.
23	It's possible to squeak by in Texas with that defense, if you play your cards right. 
20	Think many people misunderstood your intentions here and the conversation just went on a tangent from there.
2	Not gonna happen, pure delusion I *aggressively* call this ridiculous bluff
19	You sound upset.
4	I don’t know about romance, but I can certainly speak for the [NAME]
20	He already did
20	The only thing that changed is we are now healthcare-less
20	I just call em like I see em, [NAME]
20	Are you an [NAME] or [NAME]?
10	Doesn't quite have the same ring to it
18	For the [NAME] I always love our deep ACC Tourney runs. I’d love a regular season championship though
20	More QUAD BRICKS
7	Oh no now I'm caught in the suspense, what could have happened?
12	He must've done something real bad. I played with a guy who by all counts was an asshole but never received more than mutes.
10	Yup, it all starts with [NAME]. He’s not the worst owner in the nfl, but he’s in the bottom half for sure. 
4	Teen should report him for abuse.
5	That is a bad reason to come back to her. Better to be alone for the right reasons than be with someone for the wrong reasons.
7	[NAME] finally getting WCW going I see..
21	Cool story bro
4	Nothing special, just love a good knife fight. Bonus Revive.
7	What's your point? All these comments are from people who clearly had not seen it before. Only a couple said they had.
13	I love snow! It means snow days!
0	I had the biggest smile!
5	I will pray for you. [NAME] bless
20	Please leave this dude
1	I am! And I have no idea! Lol sorry. I have some of my own and I couldn't even name them to you.
20	Yea but you seem to forget how bad we were last year. Worst year in the franchise history.
20	What would constitute proof to you?
20	Bro tip: If you try this but still can't find any 10s, you can still have an extremely mediocre threesome with 2 5s
3	You can’t say that that’s racist!!!!!!
20	Oh same here. Too relatable. Makes me wonder what 50 year old me will miss about the body I've got now.
20	r/NagafenCoD is ecstatic
2	C'mon baby, C'MON DEEP SHIT
10	I can't help it when everyone just loves us ¯_(ツ)_/¯
1	Rule of cool: horses are sweet, and fun, and lancing someone is an awesome animation.
14	It would probably be horrifying if we tried, when a bug causes an integer overflow and resets our aggression levels. 
11	One wrong kick can end oh so horribly
17	Happy cake day u/sneakpeekbot!
7	Pretty sure he stayed because he was told he's got the NE job once [NAME] is gone.
20	Can't. Prequel bad. Bearded [NAME] Man idea bad. OT era only good thing.
0	Wait. Is this a parenting book with a typo? Because this seems to be a great approach to use with a toddler.
5	Where's your helmet?! Gotta love helmets.
6	"""are you related?"" ""No"" ""Are you <more specific type of related>?"""
20	I personally prefer FIT to refer to these kinds of transphobes: Feminist-Identifying Transphobe.
1	Come on, this would be funny with a better caption.
20	Remember when the media ignored all of the horrible things [NAME] did? Including what he did to Syria?
4	You and everybody else is free to contribute though. Unlike r/bitcoin where all of us once came from.
5	remember what you're fighting for
7	Curious as to why he's been passed up so many times now.
20	I think the use of taxpayer money was a secondary point behind the potential government use of an actor to mislead.
3	The fact that [NAME], the other principal in the original story, has gotten out of this unscathed is annoying.
10	My favorite way is not prepping half of what I'm supposed to
20	> DoorDash also does this. u/workingwa?
4	Yeah right like they always talk about themselves why can’t I gets me so pissed off
10	They're obviously not.
15	For sure. Thank you.
15	I have his signature on my jersey. Lined up at Canadian Tire for it when I was younger. Happy retirement!
17	*Poop hole* Oooohwee!
2	Because it would look worse than 2D art.
23	That's what I ended up actually doing.
10	Why u watching the NFL? Your [NAME] emperor told you that’s a no-no. You dare disobey your master and lord?!?
20	You are wrong.
13	Reckon she'd have your back too OP!
20	No, he was hecka hungry and coming down to McDonald’s would mean being caught.
0	It's amazing how polar opposite [NAME] is from Thibs
17	And they lived happily ever after.
18	This is my favorite picture in this sub
20	C'mon. Ship computer would *never* cheat on Geordi La Forge!
0	Sweetie, you claim you’re happy but you sure don’t sound like it.
20	I’m just waiting for the right director to actualize this subversion of our expectations.
12	So cringy and desperate
10	Unfortunately 22tcm is not standardized, as long as it's Armscor exclusive it's irrelevant.
20	Cervezas for everyone!
0	It took me, like, 3 hours to finish the shading on your upper lip. It's pretty much the best drawing I've ever done.
7	Are they bigger than our defensive breakdowns and [NAME] five hole?
7	maybe you learned it from the yellow vest movement in France?
21	There's no in between. Your example is the only other way they could have handled it.
20	This sounds familiar. But no it will be [NAME] fault. She MADE [NAME] hurt you for the greater good. /s
2	Stop laughing at me.
7	Well if you already bought them why throw them away? Use them up and don't buy anymore.
1	I always find myself wondering where people are from, sometimes it is obvious though haha.
17	gotta get that AA out yo! 😂
8	I hope [NAME] likes my Thanos costume though.
4	I agree that all people deserve respect and to be free from harassment, intimidation, or assault.
15	Ah ok. Thank you!
20	I was going to suggest that it was likely a 96 or something. I could see how a 96 Dom would be $500 depending on the circumstances.
9	It’s only missing a line that says “who was born in June” for absolutely no reason
4	yes. crossing the border by land or sea into or from Canada, Mexico, Bermuda or the Caribbean. All you need is an enhanced license. 
4	Thats the second quickest way I know of to burn through $1,000...The first being: R/WallStreetBets 🤣
4	Because it's the one right that we hope to never need, at least in the sense of revolt or self defense.
9	It's a shitty made shirt but if it was done well I'd wear it.
7	So you’ve known each other a while, but how close are you?
20	At least they were nice enough to cut the stinger off.
0	Great Expectations!
25	Whatever you do, don't give your virginity to anyone. You will regret it if you give it up cheaply. 
7	Are you assuming that all of [NAME] friends are mutual friends of whoever took this screenshot?
23	He’s not the brilliant tactician he’s made out to be.
25	I miss [NAME] wish we could trade back for him!
4	Well I mean Australia is a good example of this working isn’t it ?
20	You come off as very cold and uncaring there.
20	In what ways has [NAME] out-coached [NAME]? I see this all the time and yet never any examples.
13	I'm going to look so handsome for you, [NAME].
20	> Conversely, Scandinavia does alright. That’s what they said about Venezuela. 
11	Taking the baby is the creepiest thing they’ve done yet - just so evil, in a dim, giggly way.
20	Should probably change the title to add that it is for medical only.
15	Ahh gotcha - thanks :)
20	Even stuff like Bud Light and PBR has a place.
21	Oh man. I had to do it last year. Hopefully my leaders think more highly of me this year.
20	You can say what you want about USM, but we love our baseball.
20	If you do, the defecation will impact the rotary oscillating atmospheric circulation device.
4	Sacrifice the individuals rights for the greater good of the community. That's the definition of fascism.
2	Cus the left doesn't give a shit about people who fought for the USA!
10	Stop arguing with people.
20	I feel your pain brother. Just had to put down my rescue pup. RIP blaze it for them!
20	I'm not just. I wanna know why its a thing all of a sudden.
9	> It's a bad precedent to start once this community grows. Community does what?
9	Started feeling smug about my short showers but then remembered just how small my water heater is.
8	[NAME] I hope this permanent.
0	Good job on 112 bro
20	If so, then LN payments are *not* safer than unconfirmed TXs.
11	Both are weird.
6	Oh. It really is [RELIGION]. I was wondering if that was a bad gag.
27	omg pizza time with junko time
18	I love u too <3
18	Love hearing [NAME] talk about money not gonna lie.
15	I didn't see it the first time and appreciate the repost.

18	I rly like trench coats Not not in that combination tho
0	Its very popular in the not comic book demographics.

13	Wow! Prayers for everyone there.

1	Should have just looked at them in disbelief and said what you don't make the police that have to work Christmas day a nice lunch. Lol
2	I was freaking out watching this. WTF are the parents!?
4	I think they are leaving it up because they know they can't delete it.

1	Seems fun, wonder how she would have ended up if the ca er was not there
15	> Consult /r/ssbbw (NSFW) for a better answer. Thanks. But no thanks. I'll take your word for it.
20	In the letter I told her she was disrespectful and that we will not ask her to housesit again.
20	Ech even if he wanted to just be friends i dont think its okay to just ignore you like that. I think you dodged a bullet.
21	Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result
0	Well...... can only hope it works out in America’s best interest now
4	[NAME] and [NAME] knew all along
20	I had the same problem
18	Wow two shitty reactions out of order, judging by the way [NAME] looks at you the sweetest.
6	What country are you in? That makes a big difference for context of advice.
3	Watch the ignorance of a variety of topics manifest itself as word diarrhea just falling out of her dumb mouth.
6	I thought [NAME] was dope. Never understood the hate for it
1	haha good one friend real neato joke!!!!
4	dude people here can be assholes. there’s nothing wrong with taking a break.
9	Well poops. My friend and I want to wander and look for such things but we can't. Boo!

26	I adore this comment section <3
0	Binged through this last night. Interesting and entertaining. I'd love to see more.
26	Good lord, that 'chandelier' made entirely out of antlers is pretty ridiculous 👀 
4	Checkout real cool people that I'm sure would love to help you out.
20	Pretty much. Him and [NAME] will share ball handling duties. Point Lance and Point Outlaw in the house
5	She actually does that, because she sees that you are happy, but the person behind you really needed that :P
20	happy cake day.
3	She already is. The darling that WTA so badly needed with the talent to back
20	No organic webs, no [NAME], no [NAME]. Pack your memes, get out of my subreddit. You're NOT [NAME]!
3	Sure, there are plenty more if you are so unsatisfied
20	I'd prefer it that way than the alternative reality in which [NAME] knows where I live.
20	It did, my LL ex was emotionally and verbally abusive. When I left, it was because I'd rather be *alone* than stay with her. 
6	Sorry man, I have no idea either! 
0	This was amazing
20	That they don't work for everyone doesn't mean they are a scam.
20	I, too, thought it was carrying a dildo
14	I worry that as soon as VR and AR take off, it'll be the nail in the coffin and we will be trapped.
15	[NAME], I could’ve written the last part, and the first part serves as a potent warning.m that I needed to hear. Thank you.
20	Oh. :[
3	What a waste of packaging.
13	I know exactly who you’re talking about! He has a documentary on Prime!
0	I really like the colours but I'm wondering where that bit of shadow on the chin comes from.

7	Is this a real thing? I'm a terrible stoner.
6	31? Congrats on the wizard powers, at least. What spells did you learn?

20	The Donald raiders are the most savage of the bunch, they not only downvote brigade but also annihilate civil debates

4	Me too please

18	Hi [NAME] nice to see you

23	Just saying that there's no reason to go easy on the rich breeders.
20	[NAME] has personal experience with people turning into remorseless killers. What he thinks of walkers is immaterial.

26	I think not living with him in advance is a big mistake.

4	I'm sure the two young sons of [NAME] are comforted by the fact that the cops involved didn't want to kill an unarmed man.

27	Wonder if some of the ‘cuse guys we got because nobody was available anymore will be cycled out

20	I would love to know the Governor'sr's response to that line!
0	[NAME] was barely established waaat she really had a generic design in mk9 and we already saw this look in the comics and it looked great
0	Not cheating and not using exploits is honorable. Other opinions are not relevant imo.
4	Because some women are capable of seeing past physical appearance and are intelligent enough to try to get to know someone instead of making snap judgements.
5	she seem immature, playing mind games. I would be direct and if she still keeps playing games let her go. seems like an attention seeker.
20	The Cavs didn’t even want [NAME]. They just wanted to fuck with us.
4	I heard on the scanner app of two trauma patients to IMC.
20	We have [NAME] in Iowa, too bad this story doesn't affect US stores, I would be driving the extra distance to support these guys

20	No love for [NAME]. Team MVP is [NAME] but [NAME] deserves the offensive MVP he was a game changer when healthy and was electric.
20	[NAME] (swt) does not need your worship. If you do good deeds and humble yourself and seek forgiveness He might guide you again.
3	Yeah I think he was joking though. Like a cynical, sarcastic sorta comment

20	Would've Been Sober For About 2 Years Now.
10	It seems to be his Twitter reactions really. He prob needs to spend less time there
17	They gave me free Subnautica which is an incredibly wonderful game so I'm pretty darn happy. And it's not exclusive.
7	And here's quick exercise. Can you list five little things you're grateful for? Not big things...little things.
9	I hadn’t even noticed the hairline, was too busy looking at the rest of the awful stuff going on.

4	I unironically approve of this message. It is time for the French Revolution to end.
20	Scratch that, tickets go on sale February 7th.
2	It's a statistically slightly worse ICR, take that as you will.
14	I want to clarify that I am NOT scared. I punched the mirror because it looked at me wrong.
21	I'm hopeful but going in with tempered expectations. There have been some remasters in which I was really disappointed. BioShock comes to mind.
25	Lmao I’m so sorry but yet intrigued as to how it contributed to your breakup?
20	>... The parent’s finish up ... Committed to the cause!

15	Not really the point I'm making, but thanks.
1	I hope that's real lol
14	he is a very dangerous man
20	Probably it is a lot less memorable for those rich guys since they eat this type of stuff so often it stops being a special experience altogether.

20	First time, health/environmental reasons. Second time, because of a woman.

10	Noooo I missed the blood moon again. Someone post a pic
15	Thanks man....
20	Aye it's doing the rounds so I'm sure I'll see it today
10	We don't. That is exclusively a leftist thing, and you know it. 
20	It's on netflix
6	Did you miss the massive throbbing erection the Dems had over the no fly no buy thing?
13	I was streaming on my laptop so I could watch the glorious win. Sadly hunting has been tough so far. Damn those Bison.
20	Forehead for days.
4	I thought it was fairly common parents didn't let their young girls alone with boys or vice versa even though kids will do what they want.
8	Always wanted to try [NAME], I'll add her to my list.
10	She can also say she's committed to the public system while still wanting two tier. So what she said there truly means nothing.
20	this is the best thing I have read in awhile. so simple yet so hiarious.
26	I’ve massively improved but it never really gets cured. There are always situations that will give you anxiety.
1	So jealous lol we don't get to enjoy in TN :(

8	The level of envyness far too much
24	at least it wasn’t the evil [NAME].
20	The film room crew think he'd be first qb, but top drafters don't need qb
20	Bugger them all
5	how'd you know? they're soooo good
23	I don’t think I’ve ever seen that many downvotes.
20	Need those thick strong legs to give the boot to all inferior and lesser beings, keep them firmly on the ground while you stand tall over them!
3	And this young man wishes to be an athlete. That sort of strenuous activity would not be possible.
9	no job security and your prospects for future employment are severely hurt
12	The fact that he allowed himself to be bullied and pressured means he obviously lacks the courage of his convictions and should step down
9	Right there with you! Unladylike was so depressing, I couldn't keep listening to it.
21	I think that happens equally with people that are or aren't interested, it's like a reflex to move on.

9	Well then, I can't wait for you to prove me wrong but your throwaway comment isn't helpful.

18	Would love to share this on twitt and FB ...
20	That's certainly one part of the puzzle, though arguably they are non-noahide as they historically advocated for incest marriage, but maybe it is different now.
10	That's literally impossible.
9	Unhappy, I am.
7	Why is this here?
7	What about white supremacist? BLM called [NAME] a white supremacist terrorist, that label is damaging and in the same lines of a neo nazi.
4	I think a six month prison sentence is in order for that missed tackle against the cowgirls. Maybe some community service if he's got a good lawyer.
20	With him though you're supposed to be attracted to him because that's how he was able to kill so many women

20	At least she showed a reaction...
20	I may have awful taste, i would want this cake

1	When I see [NAME] venerate icons it makes you wonder if they have OCD. /s The joke is that [NAME] cross themselves more than others in my experience.
7	How long do we have to wait? I might need rehab.
0	Dude is really nice. But I’m gonna be so upset if we ignore our huge need for a small forward again.
20	That's what happens when you're high.
12	I recomend a Jasikevicius from Litva :) Sorry for English.
5	Yup. You see more hands, have to learn more to be competitive.. etc
6	I mean maybe I did too but as you said it was a decade ago or more.
20	Nothing and I mean nothing will sway a trump supporter at this point
15	Thank you xo

2	I'm just here to say fuck [NAME]
27	Really surprised I had to come this far down to find this!
20	I had the same thought

9	while it's debatable how big government should be, I'm glad someone isn't advocating for private fire departments again. that was such a disaster
0	I love [NAME]. He's another great option for 6th man.
26	Stranger than fiction. Can't even begin to comprehend what that poor [NAME] was going through.
4	Obviously a flying monkey somewhere. What a nightmare that guy is. I'm glad you cut him out of your life.
3	Me too. Damn that damsel in distress syndrome
7	Sure. Minus the ones that decided to wear MAGA hats and harass the indigenous people’s march.
3	i think people who get up in a dizzy over an add that shames bullying and sexual harassment are probably special snowflakes.
8	I’d love the current battle system blended with the old system of sneak/blending and a modern day story that Ubisoft actually care about.

2	Fuck these trendy hipster joints. Give me my shit like normal fucking people.

12	The mods deleted it I'm sorry
20	Si did you decide to change the company policy at the next board meeting or didn't you, you can't just leave us hanging like that!

8	4Chan's ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to 4Chan.
10	My point was that there is no good vote here. This is legislative battle over wall funding and any given vote makes sense only in that context.
10	They killed [NAME] for being a [NAME] right after this. [NAME] was a notorious anti-Semite.
3	"Boy just tell her to ""calm down"" or ""watch her tone"" and get it over with."

18	Me too dude. Nice video for what it was!
0	Best comment ever.

21	I would smash both
2	How dare you disparage a 3D printed JV riding a goddamn raptor
0	ah good find. I guess I saw some sort of grade 9 class photo then. Cheers.
15	You're right, that's a solid advice. I will give it some time and if I am unhappy I will start distancing myself. Thanks!
10	It means less when you hear words come out of her foul mouth. Almost incomprehensible.
7	Can't wait to see her looks in S11!
4	Mental health issues get such a bad rap as it is. I appreciate this comment a lot.

20	I bet there is an army of married couples who did the same exact thing.
3	It was so frustrating seeing him overthrow people every week. I hope he makes that a point of focus this off-season.
6	You called [NAME] a defensive player of interest. I don't know that logic is in this topic.
3	Why don't you just move to secular country like North Korea, China or Sweden? Leave theists alone we don't want you.

15	Thank you! 💓❤
15	Nice. Thanks for the original.

4	The EPA allowed DuPont to use a chemical that literally kills people in their nonstick pans. They can be bought too unfortunately.
2	[NAME] and his supporters are the dumbest humans in the fucking galaxy. They should be locked up for their own safety.

4	That's clearly a clickbait title. Chances are it didn't actually happen.
3	If you really want a constant attack on yourself you gotta hit up r/TooMeIRLForMeIRL
3	Congratulations!!! And I hope those people who tried to interfere in your marriage feel very foolish now. How wonderful this is!💕
4	i communicate through morse code by constantly crouching and standing up. I generally prefer explaining how my oponent can improve when i beat them badly

21	Let's not name anything after him. Even if it's a disorder, the incels will take it as recognition and pride.

25	Sorry to hear about that! Are you just under observation? Any anti-clotting drugs they're pushing?
20	If they really were silk that would at least be something.
20	Watching [NAME] flip his head back every poke of contact is possibly the most frustrating thing to watch
2	oh shit u meant the actual post... yeh i live in china this all we got😂😂
20	What you mean you weren’t looking forward to that scene? ;)
26	I'm missing something
0	1 is spot on. Anxiety completely disappears. I like when that happens. One less issue

27	That's... pretty unexpected actually.
25	Please. Sorry.
17	Really I like the new fatalities
26	Uh...no
3	Journalists not writing the headlines remains one of the most frustrating aspects of print media on digital platforms.
10	It is 100% a scam. They've been copying many [NAME] with the same message.
13	You were really fortunate! See, that’s what I imagined would happen... 
20	Socio emotional anus! What vision
25	shit. Sorry man :( They have great deals from now and then though via stacksocial. Check them from time to time.

1	Haha gutted.
3	Honestly mate, highest I've got to is only 1623 but put me up against an axe or a cannon and I'm just dead.
3	The [NAME] camp is psycho. They're the same people that called [NAME] supporters deplorables.
4	Ok nice opinion dude. Do you have any sources??
0	Finally, I can sit on another person’s lap and have them not be disgusted
26	Sold out. Sorry my dude!
12	One of the most memorable games I’ve been to. And I got some great seats for an even better price.
17	How much time you got? I enjoy *The Spirit of Redemption* but it's a bit long.
3	[NAME] believe in evolution and the hat isn't racist just because you say so. Quit trolling.
20	[NAME] are already in negotiations for a licensed game about shaving and toxic masculinity.
9	“Regain the fan base”. How immature do you have to be to believe that everyone agrees with you.
3	If I have to watch Canada lose in a shootout I'm gonna lose it

2	That’s the silver lining of this. Fuck Veracruz.
4	I had a year that felt very, very long. There are way worse things than life feeling short.
13	I actually have to try, to see what happens
6	That convention center sized groan right after the reveal.... No one wanted this. I have no idea what they were thinking.
4	Or maybe just don't have a family and you're financially secured for life.

20	I got mine at 21. The ex wife would have had me snore instead of wear it for years.
11	It’s ugly. Bye bye and good riddance.
10	But really though, it really contextualizes how bad this coaching search has been that the Rams' QB coach is the only guy we can be optimistic about
17	Happy for u!!

4	He was also involved in a much less known NBC investigation into

26	Well that didn't take long, sorry for your loss :(
24	Putting them away feels so good it’s worth the frustration. Snipers dropped my career KD by like .15 >__<
20	Have you read /r/NEET ? You'll find that not all people hate being unemployed - they choose to be unemployed.
15	Thank you. Message me.
7	That and customizable CSS makes me so happy. /r/Firefoxcss if you’re interested : )
20	[NAME] take a biology class you social darwinist scum.
5	He needs to go knit or something.
9	It'll be hard to surive on that wage in Vancouver. It's expensive AF here.
2	Technically it’s the abdomen. Stomach and belly are just informal synonyms. That girl is a racist and an idiot.
2	And a hell of a lot better receivers. [NAME], [NAME], prime [NAME], [NAME]. 
2	That's even worse honestly
4	I agree: most [NAME] are much better than Prophet [NAME], which directly contradicts [RELIGION] doctrine.
20	There’s no where for him to play. He wants to play [NAME] and that’s taken by [NAME]. We have [NAME] at 3rd.
9	I'd say Rick and Morty fans. I'm a fan of both but I feel that Rick and Morty fans take everything way more seriously.
1	Lol just leave it bruh it adds character
9	Omgsh. What’s bad is if you look at her two years ago she looks normal and just beautiful and then it progressively gets scary
20	Cray to the crazy
1	Yeah lol. 25% of women are sexually assaulted in [RELIGION] countries, maybe. 
4	The women-are-wonderful effect.
20	I bet if anyone else had his condition without being a Veteran would have served some sort of punishment.
3	Well, since everything in Australia wants to kill you, I'd say it is quite healthy to be afraid of Australian spiders, and other flora and fauna 
25	Damn, that's the only war we lost. 
10	Hmm... I don't think EPCOR is the reason the oilers suck
1	thats why she is going crazy lmao

0	You're a bad person, but a great [NAME].
17	Hey if any are left, I'd like to happily donate!
15	Thanks...One year in making, I hope it gets the love it deserve.

23	"Do you mean a ""theocracy""?"
5	Find yourself a partner who's sensible enough to slip out of their clothes and find new ones rather than destroy a perfectly good robe.
10	They lead a bad defense though. And [NAME] isn’t blameless here, he’s not good against the run.
0	Good luck trying to get out of the membership. They won’t make it easy.
20	Wait for it...
17	Usually fly fishing. During winter I like cooking, enjoying a glass of wine or a joint. 
3	Sadly that's probably the worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
20	Everyone is a little toxic inside. I feel like killers being toxic comes from survivors being toxic and vice versa. It's a vicious cycle.
23	/u/allegedlynerdy is referring to China not Russia, as obviously Russia is not “religion free,” but atheist China is still very homophobic.
0	One of the better shutdown memes I've seen. Have an upvote.
17	You're welcome
4	This looks more like 1954.
10	"He didn't ""die"". The dude behind pink guy doesn't want to continue being pink guy"
20	> it's not the fault of the mods or uses of this sub. They are the people enforcing it. Why wouldn't you blame them?
20	So I’m not invested for the rest of the season. Wife is, though. Go Bears.
10	That’s what I thought. With 4 out of the 9 still on the show, I just can’t call it accurate at all.
1	"My favorite so far is ""national emergency declares national emergency."""
20	This sub blows, and you’re on the wrong side of the circlejerk today
8	I don’t like [NAME] all that much, but that dude seems cool. I hope it hits a goofy dark line like [NAME] or [NAME] tho.
27	Oh god the “glow”! I get comments about it at work almost weekly.
20	He’s still alive so far. [NAME] is going to check on him.
7	What was the first insult from [NAME] to [NAME]? I think I missed it
26	At least your stepdad didn't just take the pillow look at you and leave...
0	It's amazing the advantage that you have when you advocate for the ruling oligarchs.
9	Yeah me too, because I would’ve been a lot more pissed if they would’ve got tired of waiting and left.
4	Riot keeping nailing it in the cinematic and music department. That was so fun to watch, especially how amazing [NAME] and [NAME] part was.
0	Thank you for this very informative answer. I don't play the game but you really explained well why they put this system in place.
26	Such a sad way to think of life all because these people believe there's something greater than this.
20	Its weird because I didn’t say “house cat” I just said “cat” yet you felt the need to correct me.
23	Same with the seated calf machine always leave a plate on.
19	You are nervous. Just focus on the other stuff my dude.
20	What?
20	Rural MO. The nearest Whole Foods is an hour away. I can't imagine too many [NAME] could handle the distance.
27	oooo, if that had gone in...so close Looked like [NAME] tipped it down instead of up.
21	I always hope that a woman will ask me out...next time it happens will be the first.
20	It doesn't *meet* any moral or ethical standpoint.
4	You like [NAME] but dislike [NAME]? That is weird considering that they both are on the same low level of intelligence.
20	Hi, I'm [NAME].
23	And it keeps rumbling... now we know why no one had gone to jail yet!
0	This idea is brilliant.
15	Dear OP: Proper punctuation please/thank you.
5	Trespassing in Texas and you’ll get shot. I would’ve shot them.
3	That may be true. I was just pointing out that the logic of an appeal to nature is fallacious
0	shits awesome!
20	Because you’re insecure with double standards, got it. 
20	Is this guy from Bogota?! I saw a very similar fellow in Columbia when I was there last year
0	So smart it looks like he shut his fingers in the door. That’s a nasty bruise under his fingernail.

0	Folks, the Baconator is great! Ask anyone, it's the best sandwich. The bacon is amazing. Great sandwich.
27	I'm shocked. You mean to say the economic model adopted by every single financially successful country on the planet actually works? /S
22	I agree with you, but you know, sharia *is* sharia, which I find a tad more frightening 
7	to 6:30. Does that look fake to you?
20	I genuinely cannot believe [NAME] didn't get fired years ago. It shocks me more than [NAME].
20	"I'd have responded ""no problem,I'll just return it"" "
10	Fat dont fail me now!!
5	You got whooshed fair and square. Take your medicine.
2	It's probably because your posts are extremely dumb and bigoted

20	[NAME] fan here, He did trade [NAME], it was for a 2018 4th and 2019 7th.
20	there are a lot of heroes who have tricky mechanics, tinker especially for me
23	I was just about to comment this. Do people think throwing an lol at the end of everything will just make it fine and dandy. Ridiculous lol.
15	Thanks so much!!!
20	Because [NAME] is a free agent after this season so he could just leave when this season is basically a lost cause for us
7	Well being in the playoff picture for a couple months was fun. What does the draft look like this year?
7	[NAME] were the only reason this episode was remotely interesting lmao
5	Win the information war, freedom fighter.
1	Because it was smh lol
20	That’s where he collected pebbles and hid them in the carton become part of that same alias I used.
20	let's hope it gets better.
20	When they tell me “oh my [NAME] you don’t look 22, you look 15” 
4	Wow first fight in a while where I don't want either dude to lose.
0	Appreciate you!
20	this gif encapsulates exactly how I feel commenting in FT vs everyone else here
7	Is that how friendship works? Holy crap, I've been missing out!

2	Or plan ahead, call 511 periodically for updates, and don't put your shitty load ahead of your own life.
12	That's a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
18	I love the creative writing that stems from this sub, so entertaining.
17	thats cool to hear ... [NAME] really is laughable in this regard
5	[NAME] fits at 3 separate funerals plus almost every very serious uncomfortable conversation I've ever had would indicate you're not alone. [NAME].
4	Read the title of this post. I said ugly people can be LIKED. But people don’t truly FALL IN LOVE with physically unattractive people
6	You know what's coming, right?
10	Doesn't help that it's not actually cheese. Looks like a pretty standard Vegan mac+whatever you wanna call it
20	> Government is not entitled to deny contracts because of free speech. Literally yes they are lmfao.
4	Can confirm as my first time commuting by motorcycle in the rain there was hail, then lots of thunder bolts and lightning , found it very very frightening. 
10	That, plus they also store our info insecurely so it leaks out. Just another part of this dumb economics game I guess...
20	[NAME] forgot leg day
21	I’m not sure how to feel after reading this... I will say that [NAME] and [NAME] would be an attractive couple.
3	Id buy those shoes and walk in the dirtiest places just to piss [NAME] off.
4	Whatever you say, mate. Good luck trying to tell kids not to love their parents.
20	Only an idiot would visit places like China or NK. Arbitrary abductions and detentions against foreigners have happened for a long time now.
20	Furthermore the kids are staying with you and wife can move out of the family home and back in with MIL.
6	Project stream?
5	I guess [NAME] has something he wants to tell you
25	I'm sorry for you, but that pic is in the wrong subreddit.
3	[NAME]? You can't walk by without squishing his cheeks!

18	I love how he says the crime *solving* boat, like there was another show about a boat committing crimes. 
0	One thing I appreciate about the Prequel trilogy is that it explores the rise of fascism better than *Fantastic Beasts* movies could do.
20	So I play competitive with a group of people and being the one widow is most likely fake or just wild speculation.
20	Input: Drink candle. NPC: You don't want to get wax in your mouth, do you? Input: Maybe I do, NPC.
18	Slightly obscure I like it. I’ll add crash.
20	If they really were silk that would at least be something.
10	You want to fix them. You can’t. This was a hard life lesson for me to learn. I also am a giant loser magnet.
20	"But ""[NAME] knows the heart! The baby will be in heaven."" Yeah....."
3	That's until a golden retriever runs for office. Humans can't be trusted
20	I said I'm full, sir. That means no desert either. No one likes a pushy waiter.
3	And you were too stupid to find your own sriracha, or you thought that $7.50 entitled you to your personal dancing monkey.
10	I’m not signing that 😂 dude can hopefully stay banned
20	Same at my office. Just sitting and waiting until DC tells us what to do
16	No the limiting factor is the leader raped a young boy and paid his silence
4	I was looking for this comment, was not disappointed.
2	How the hell
9	Anything that moves us away from the 5 man push meta on SnD. Playing SnD without stuns and nades hasn’t felt right.

0	you too good sir
17	Man, I would cry tears of joy if my two-year-old cousin could just say my name, let alone say a coherent sentence.
25	I bring great shame on my family with my poops. If only I had the will of dear god emperor [NAME] to halt my poops indefinitely like is able.
10	The “figuring it out” part seems really hard
19	I'm getting worried
12	It’s embarrassing to share a license with them, that’s for sure.
4	Pretty sure the plate is completely visible in the article...
2	It’s fine. Baby boomers are always angry
3	Holy shit, it's never occurred to me I'll still be anxious at 50. Thanks for this, very informative
4	I am not regreting my life, there is so much interesting stuff on the internet
2	Ur actually stupid lol.
1	Omg i love you hahahahgaha
0	This was a beautiful moment for the FT coming together

20	Go on the website it’s super easy to get hired loading trucks that’s for sure
3	Most of the people commenting in /r/Libertarian aren't libertarians, but are just there to tell libertarians how stupid and evil they are.
25	Powerful stuff. I'm sorry I gave you this much time and credit.
4	Less of “It’s my baby too” and more of “it’s an innocent living being and you want to murder it”.
3	[NAME], someone get her a green card so she can clean rooms at the Super 8 and stop obsessing on social media. 
5	All I've said about that topic is that I support abortion but I think birth control and sterilization are better.
20	There were rumors for a long time to work out and I ended up making it smaller.
10	No real man would allow his woman to be even looked at by someone else, let alone allow another man to have sex with her
20	>I just hope Lovejoy is back Phrases I'd never expect to hear for $600 [NAME]
15	That's right nearby. Thanks!
4	ugh, same. it also gave me the shakes, so I quit. so far, I've found Trintellix to be a nice compromise

21	Very entertaining matchup. I really hope we can squeak out the win.
15	Hardcore Henry.
15	Thanks for the gold
20	Ah, the ol' plurality of majesty.

4	Fine, you're right, they should just have a random fascist activist.
9	[NAME]? Rape? I am shocked I tell you! SHOCKED!
17	Happy cake day!
11	His best season was a luck filled one. He'd be nothing more than what [NAME] and [NAME] already offer but with worse defense and a worse bat.
20	[NAME] damn that apron bump looked like it sucked
20	[NAME] and [NAME] have said peach is by far bowser’s worst MU in the past. They discuss it in this thread:

15	There is so much positive support and affirmation in this thread and I love it. Congratulations OP.
20	Oh shit, as a matter of fact my knees are now weak
4	Oh 100%. And I could see [NAME] & [NAME] both picking [NAME] cause of how she wanted to play the game.
0	I find it gross, especially when it starts to cool. Chicken is great but leave it out of my dip and off my pizza.

19	Had a stroke reading these.
9	[NAME] missed it solely because they've moved from the Rookies vs Sophomores format.
20	Maybe we will see each other over on that thread and everyone can openly mock me. You should submit it!
9	I don't like [NAME] this season but she's always been a favorite before. Am I the only one? She has an edge that seems unlikable
7	So if the company announces they are recording the call, can I also record the call without telling them? Because they already know they're being recorded.

25	[NAME]? Too soon?
27	Sounds like my kind of place.
20	next time offer dude a hit of your weed, ive been waiting for that to happen to me
5	Not really if they are busy. They may not even take a break. But again if they are regularly not responding than it is probably an issue.
20	Back to not getting a seat despite being 3 stops from the end of the line.
14	Yes. One of her fingers is getting a sore on it and there’s concern it may push her into needing braces.
20	*my sister and my mommy. they just edamame*
10	I disagree. In that I believe that season 3 was also very good. I think it's better than season 4.
1	Lmao, I really messed this up. Loved your replies in the og thread, mate, keep up the good work :). 
20	What do you know about art

26	Ah, I read it wrong. Jzk.

20	Update; i can't sleep too many thoughts of her and pressure from asking her out tomorrow.. yesturday i was high so i could fall a sleep easly.
3	That’s horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.
20	it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.
6	I'd pause and say yes...? Haha.

13	Drunk [NAME] sounds like something I want to see
20	I failed with my play on words. Oh well, can't win them all
3	Doesn't matter, you don't deserve an advantage over everyone else just because you have a disability. Edit: Lol, downvoted for stating a fact.

18	Thank you for the references!
3	Do You Shit Fart?

20	How did they not know internets is a point reward in 4chan?

18	Thins are my favorite and I will not apologize. It makes the flavor of the cookie shine through.
14	What a weird character to use for something like this
20	Boy you sure can make some word vomit. You must be scared all the time to have such pessimistic views of people.
14	Ehhh I don’t know, I still find it kind of cringey with the “[NAME]” talk and all that stuff.

15	Thanks, now I can get back to the actual content
0	The duck looks very dignified. Some might even say he looks presidential.
4	Keeping the stomach warm also helps. Holding the baby with their stomach against yours helps them fall asleep. But it doesn't work all the time unfortunately.
0	That would be crazy premature. But would be awesome later when results are out and the stories behind the scenes of the [NAME] team emerges.
2	What's the fucking point of this post? Is just baseless claims with no proof to back them up.
7	"When did he claim it was ""destroying Western civilization""?"

5	I guess that was a compromise with that native sarong that he likes to wear.
20	Guys how are we doing? Asking because dumb TV in my country prefers Copa d'Italia to fucking Real Madrid lol
20	Pfft. That's awful of him and her. They deserve each other then. Grab your shite and gtfo. Hope he enjoys his fog and dysfunction.
20	[NAME] understand a hudna like this alludes to quranic truces made by [NAME], which he violated on extremely flimsy pretenses once the strategic situation shifted in his favor.

27	Wow, that's clunky.
6	I know a guy who knows a guy who gets things.

20	Welcome to my world. fml
4	True dat. I’m an AFC guy, but I’m even more an AFC West guy. Send the [NAME] home, Chefs!
15	I like you. Hi.
10	it is not so simple. lacking hormones makes things difficult to deal with when they otherwise would be bearable.
20	Yep, it is public and others waiting for their case are there.

25	Sorry about that! Edited with the addition of those details.
7	I'm sorry but are you implying that everything to the right of full-blown communism is the center?
6	My mom does this all the time. I've always wondered why she feels the need to do it. Can you tell me why you do it?
20	I picked it so it forced me to stay anonymous.
10	Yes. Some things are simply not allowed.
20	[NAME] forbid I’m actually anti-war and anti-theft and want my vote (or lack thereof) to reflect those philosophies.
15	ahhh sorry its late and bourbon fuzz has set in. thanks for the fast reply !!!!
18	I love this sort of thing, reminds me of when my dad took me to the SW special edition when I was a little kid.

4	No I actually really like that I don’t have to pump my own gas.
2	Well [NAME], you got the wrong guy. I never downvoted you. I hope your day gets better.
27	[NAME] damn it, dude. Are you trying to ensure every gun owner in PA votes red? Because that's how you do that.

1	There’s always that one friend 😂
4	It’s been a pleasure, as I’m sure it always is with you.
7	How many guys did they have on IR? I think their top 2 lineman at each spot were out at least. Hell, they almost beat us.
2	The argument [NAME] is making is that expecting women to cook is considered sexist but expecting men to shovel snow is fine. It's about the double standard.
0	Wow. No words. America, the land of opportunity!!!!!
2	You’re hardly qualified to talk.
0	You're obviously a size queen. Go find yourself a big penis.
20	I had a 2 litre bottle. It went flat before I opened it, nearly wept.
10	Yes. Once I went to lunch so late in a 9-5 job it was dark when I got back.
20	Now, I'm trying to figure out who [NAME] could be in my memory banks.

20	If he's still blaming [NAME] for his issues, the therapist is doing a bad job.
3	Behavior I'd consider deeply immoral without showing true remorse (I'm talking rape, torture of animals, that sort of thing).
9	I've never seen him play so hard on defense. This feels different this time is all I'm saying...
12	"Weird how ive been ""attempted"" the same scam twice and im just a nobody.. Probably more or less amatur x'D"
21	I imagine that 50 years ago that's exactly the position he would take
26	Wow, what a violent cunt.
20	He could have spent way less money on backpage when it was still around or Craigslist...would have gotten around the same quality or better too.
0	That sounds so awesome. Thanks for talking about it.
4	And when it's time to get him into violent videogames, just get him Viscera Cleanup Detail

3	Because you had the audacity to reply when called out makes me think you might have trouble understanding sarcasm, which you have my condolences for.
4	Or you could learn to reverse park and stop whining. It’s a lot easier to park backwards.

23	The name he asked if I was, was some foreign name. It was so far off from my actual name I thought it was a joke at first 
26	Im at the game,somebody please put me out of my misery 
1	Gee that sure is a strange way to spell [NAME].
0	Omgg yes [NAME] precious
23	They could just lie! And then only musicians who look at it and can do reasonable sightreading would know they're lying.
20	We've had so many stories about [NAME], that we do NOT need any about Florida lady. LOL
7	Don't see a W tonight. We need a miracle.
14	I would be afraid he would come back and somehow blame me for his failure.
6	Doubt that, too good to be true
3	American democracy is weak but it's not dead. If the intention of your comment was to discourage people from voting then you are the problem.
20	Okay will try to contact the restaurant owner/manager
20	Close the door, you're letting the heat out!
2	I still defend the evening gown .. that purple and that wig were right
2	Can a lad please send me one of whatever the fuck this is plz.

20	I want MY window seat because I am a child!
6	All voting has all sorts of problems. Struggling to find a point to your post.
5	It hasn’t happened yet. Just talk to the supervisor or HR. In the meantime don’t borrow trouble.
2	[NAME] from ZoE and [NAME] from TTGL. Actually fuck all that [NAME] from The Big O is where it's at.
13	I hope. Sirens got me excited
20	Yeah me too. I understand liking white noise in background for some people but asmr can get kinda freaky at times.
25	Yeah sorry about that I don't mean it.
4	I stand corrected. IQ is not worthless. Knowing ones own IQ aids in masturbation.
3	If its affecting your mental health, you know what to do. You have a commitment to yourself first and foremost.
4	Then let’s keep scrolling and posting to push this thread to the bottom - let them waste their time on someone who is absolutely irrelevant at best.
27	What?! I am level 20 and I already had 4. I did 5 hide outs in total not counting the tutorial hide out.
20	LN is flawed by design and BTCs limited on-chain capacity cannot carry mainstream LN onboarding.
10	Also technically wrong, it would be last year but not a year ago.
25	I'm so sorry
7	Certainly possible. I think you can wait until 15 but that's just a gut thing.
5	lol dont try and fucking blame [NAME] for not passing it to a guy who has been bricking all night.
27	I thought that, but not quite as extreme!!
18	Love this man, take my updoot.
9	This is the scariest thing I think I’ve ever read on here. That is just so horrible.
20	Man... it’s been a while since I laughed so hard watching one of these vids
0	Officer [NAME] is the penultimate FA character. Apart from the fact he's attractive of course AAAAAAAAAAAAH
20	What mental illness am I displaying?
20	Ok so how do I put money on this? Because I do not see Mac shelling out the goods to make that happen
0	He's worth it I think. Dude brings it 110% every game
2	Just legalize it, already. Do it the proper way instead of by executive fiat. I hate the lawlessness—“the pen and a phone” bullshit.
10	I'm the exact opposite. The idea of not existing anymore relaxes me and makes me want to end it
6	unblockables and cc moves do not affect him while in bulwark stance or at least he can also counter them (not sure how the stance works)
0	Amazing, my friend 🙏 
1	I for one am with you on this train. I loved [NAME] man but this sub is losing its damn mind lol
23	🤷🏼‍♀️ I was wondering the same thing. It looked almost like a teriyaki.
3	yes but this is a crazy person. That's like telling Two-Face he doesn't have to flip a coin before committing a crime lol.
21	The impact of his head hitting the court looked so bad. I hope he'll recover from this.
4	> They are all one entity with the same goals. Agreed, sadly.
15	Oh word. Thanks for the heads up!
4	It's perfectly fine
23	All that matters is how you use those four inches, really

4	Ah, thank you! I’ve only seen them as decoration and on hotel doors. I had forgotten the name, thanks!!
20	I think he's said before he'd never go on question time
4	You’re a kind soul who deserves a pair of $250 coach sunglasses
0	Oh hey this is pretty awesome! I've never seen such a concise itinerary on one page before.
20	It is a kayak
4	Cheers, girl! But yeah, he could return her, but no refund or exchanges for him! 
0	My all time favorite band!!! Now my son listens to them and [NAME]!
20	I think OD needs a rework. Get rid of that crappy 50% passive and give him some sort of active or a proper passive ability.
20	This thread will be interesting.. *grabs popcorn
27	With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn’t be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
0	Damn fine post 👏👏👏 damn fine.
3	I believe they know about it and don’t care, but they aren’t paying someone that doesn’t work there to do it.
15	You've got time to turn it around. I promise you. You can get there.
10	Yes, risky. In fact don't click it at all.
18	I guess I should specify. I would like a 'right' and 'left' political viewpoint.
20	Yeah I thought so too :)
20	PLAY FRONT BACK GO
15	Oh well, you can thank all the illegals coming into America illegally for that one. 
20	I dream of a world where that won't even be an option.
20	There is some serious congnitive dissonance going on. I know, we are one's to talk, but I think cheaters are a little more self-aware. 
15	"Thank you. I've been correcting the record for triggered authoritarians for a minute! ""Mah taxes"""
3	[NAME] is hot garbage.
26	Well, that's mean :'(

20	AND HIS FATHER WAS A DRACULA
1	Yea we're already in last place, those 3 missing assures nothing lol.
13	wow wow wow hold my beer!
20	"[NAME] said ""Dine & Dish"" you know the producers set that prank up.. and clearly didn't even get the name right"
0	I like how people get upset when someone talks about how they like this game. DayZ may be the most triggering game of all time!
0	I bawled my eyes out, my best girl. 
11	This is disgusting.
27	BUT IT'S HER TURN! /s
13	I would cheer hard for a Cyborg win in that tourney.
3	Anytime I've taken benzo beforecoke, it completely negates any coke feeling
20	Is everybody forgetting that bills need to be signed by the president to become law, or get 2/3rds support in both chambers if not?
20	But the Hijab is mandated by (and therefore connected to) political Governments and political groups that otherwise do some pretty oppressive things.
20	That's crazy, my brother's cat did the same thing with me last year when I got the flu. She's usually pretty distant
6	Same thing as well! I don't know what is happening.
26	I might be alone here, but it was probably Blame Game. I don't think I heard a rap song with that much emotional intensity before.
13	Sooner or later you're both going to have to make some choices about your priorities.
4	You clearly don’t trust him. Separate before it gets too comfortable to stay.
6	Break up and be firm about. You’ve already admitted to being dishonest. Why lead him on?
21	Even if he plays bottom pairing, his hockey IQ should help the team. At least, that's my hope!
1	I was chuckling the whole time I read this, I would have loved to be there
6	Alicorn then maybe?
20	[NAME]. How are your attempts at arguing reality into agreeing with you going?
20	Instead of Rivendell, home of the elves, we get suburban sprawl.
20	His wife wears a burka too, lest her comely appearance detracts him from godly thoughts.
20	There are courts. You need to document all this and let the judge give him a tongue lashing. Not that that would make a difference...
7	Yeah let's wrap up AS4 I'm suddenly so much more excited for S11
5	Wish you the best of luck and greener pastures!
25	Sorry, but you probably do given the AVers do have a limited literary skills at the best of times.
11	Southern Mexico tends to always get fucked in the ass as well
14	Thought i was already there with the terrible title.
1	why not? standing to me isn’t as everything i need is on the floor lol
9	Middle Eastern here and watching this team lose due to silly mistakes at 3-4 am kills me
20	he's been around forever but apparently none of y'all have RES
7	Shocking description of the criminals. Never could have guessed that
26	Did you hear about that old Italian chef? Sadly, he pasta way.
8	[NAME] I wish that was me
6	So is that like your opinion or a viewpoint you can back up with solid reasoning?
3	Yessir, it gives me the creeps. That boy ain't in Scotland, and that boy ain't right.
20	I’d be cautious about making such an assumption is mine
14	That live snail got me freaked
8	But we not out performing like she is, we just need a less matte version to keep us through our daily struggle life. 
24	ok that's kind of cool....
20	Or at the very least, why can't healers have HAMMERS!? (... I miss Legion :(]
20	that’s just because they haven’t started the knitting circle yet. that’s when it gets reeaaaal crazy!
20	Not very cringey
13	Yeah I would regularly find Steelers Fans. Dunno if that demographics been changed. Oh yeah we have a lot of Cowboy fans too.
23	Wow. This is messed up.
21	Can't let it get to you. You tried, got rejected, so move on.. Believe me I know it's discouraging but everyone gets rejected. 
20	Play stupid games and win stupid prizes dude.
20	It's easier to have a discussion with a four year old. Four year olds actually want to learn new things.
7	Do u realize u can revive yourself with it once it's lvl3 ???
6	What’s the motive for doing this? To save on fuel by transporting as many people as possible in one go?
20	I know that, but it just reminds me of darkest dungeon too
7	"I'm suprised they didn't use the classic: ""[NAME]?"" "
6	in many cases both. but this has nothing to do with Japan. You can't stay on topic, can you?
24	Saves me going out to buy toilet paper today
6	Why does the feminization of a title belittle the role? I truly don't get it.
20	These shows are scripted
20	[NAME] looks veeeery nervous
21	That is a valid question, I hope it can change, but admittedly that hope is pretty small.
7	U mad [NAME]?
20	You're fine! Go ahead and vent, that's sorta what this subreddit's for. I'm the same way, don't worry.
20	That’s what everyone seems to be saying
20	as superficially as possible. i cant go deep with a guy, only with girls.
2	I'd also report to the post office... and next time these nasty neighbors come-give them the number to call and complain.
3	because people are idiots and don't like being wrong
20	We're going in a couple of weeks. It was easy to get her to go and she wants to
20	We'll let history show us what happened here.
4	Oh no atleast you found out early. I went to find help a year ago but you know i stopped going to that therapist
20	Emergency vehicle, lights on, no siren?
3	A few months ago I would have loved that idea. Hard pass now.
4	A sea of red flags. Make this guy your ex, you deserve better. 
20	Except for [NAME] whose remains are either still on the way to Winterfell or lost altogether
4	"Read the poem ""To this Day"". I just read it. I liked it."
20	"I remember when wall Wal Mart tried to ""overtake"" the German market. Eat this Wal Mart."
1	I had that, after a relationship of 2.5 years she cheated on me. Oh well, we had fun.
20	Old news in Canada.
20	A lease violation is between the landlord and the tenant, not between one tenant and another. OP has no legal rights to stop this behavior at all
6	Does it have less scope glint than the 3x medium range scope? Or any glint at all?
20	TIL screwing people over is just fine as long as you hide the evidence for long enough.
3	No point in getting rid of Keemun for another Keemun.
6	Which is why not only did PR lose but RUP was not the first choice sadly even if it had won in BC :(
14	watching [NAME] attempt hook shots gives me a panic attack, even when he makes them (which is rare)

27	I can't believe he used the N-word.
10	Definitely not. It would be so boring to have no chance year after year.
6	It’s so weird, I think it’s like excited/stressed? 
4	Hi !! I totally get you. If you want to be friends I’m here !! :)
20	Non horny girls do.

4	it’s amazing how he is already just about my favourite skater ever.
7	Just wondering why they called the cops but not an ambulance seeing as how he was covered in blood and disoriented.
17	Yup if you’re ahead and just want to spam actives I enjoy it with an upgraded cursed ankh to really hurt healing based teams
20	Except when you get put against the same 6 stack 5 times in a row and they smash you every time... was not a good time
20	With those ugly f'n belts
20	That only works for the ironclad
0	I mean, if BDN wins another SB MVP . . . you can't exactly get rid of a guy like that
24	I've finally found my people who know the struggle.
20	In this view, you claim to wield power over them, and are clearly no anarchist. You are implicitly advocating for hierarchy.
14	I don't know any but my own I'm afraid.
21	I wish to find my best one.
5	You must be heartbroken, I’m so sorry. Can you start seeing a therapist?
0	Aww man this sucks, but at least he’s going to Europe, so I’m happy for him! Goodbye [NAME]!

1	Lol kill me now
20	Yeah this is downright spooky; she's not even using that face mask.

20	QUARANTINE! QUARANTINE!
4	They were clearly ready for it. [NAME] is in [NAME] head.
7	People really spend more than $10 in an app game? I mean an actual video game I can understand but that's just...sad
14	Your not winning their hearts, your just torturing them and they end up hating you.
21	YES YOU SHOULD, although it's only in 2300. Surrounding communes get expensive quickly.
5	May [NAME] bless your effort and raise your rank in Jannah. And may he bring relief to the [NAME] and all those suffering in the umma Ameen Ameen Ameen
20	The rest areas and truck stops are booming!

4	Whistler Medical, Broken Coast, and 7 Acres... looks to be the top 3 rec producers right now.
1	Sex dolls/robots are gonna replace them any away. Funny that. 10 years ago nobody would have thought that sex workers would be replaced by robots.

20	"The Right: ""Why won't the left let us rape, abuse and brainwash children without putting their liberal noses where they don't belong."""
23	Nah it's a sexual disorder due to brain structure not aligning with body structure but continue to be an ignorant transphobe I guess.
20	There’s some Rask sparks!
23	They were pretty cool in, like, 2010, but then everyone seemed to realize that you could write on the wipeboard with the same effect. 
7	[NAME] is decent? Dude he was drafted 3rd overall he's been a massive disappointment
20	Honestly I’d believe it. [NAME] seems stuck in that high school mentality

1	Lol.... i guess your personal experience explains everything.... personally I've seen this play out numerous times in the work place..... so.....

11	That was the worst power play I’ve ever seen
13	Now if you can teach her english, the real fun starts. 
23	I mean, I believe even Showgirls is a better movie than TLJ at this point.
4	here for me scenes of [NAME] being dragged by her children
10	No. Foreigners are not allowed to preach [RELIGION] to [NAME]. Maybe not explicitly . Also They restrict donations from abroad Not just people.

20	What is that
6	You shifty leafs were too nice. Something had to be up.
20	I, too, have lied about getting hooked up by Hasbro to justify the unhealthy amount of money I have spent on Nerf guns. 
20	I dont know.. i did message him many times but he didnt reply me.. i am worried about him. I asked his mother about him
1	Lmao is this a bot?
1	Is it possible you've been banned from them? I dont know how I feel about having the special privilege to view that sub lol.

20	The story fits here -- arrogantly oblivious customers from a different viewpoint.
4	You’re not wrong, the red flags are there. You have every right to be concerned.
9	You shouldn't be using hydrocortisone on your face:

15	Thanks for the info, appreciate it. 
13	Oh hey, someone with a brain. Rare round here. 
21	On the plus side, at least you don’t waste alcohol and wake up hungover as hell at the Lions expense. 
2	Depends how irrational your spouse is, and that's often compounded when minor children are involved.
3	Carelessness will find no clemency in this place! (I was late, it seems that others have already got the best lines...)
20	Obviously there is a unicorn conspiracy perpetuated by [NAME], who are trying to suppress the truth about one-horned animals 
10	"This is not surprising at all. She's a fake trendy ""feminist"" with no perspective whatsoever."
7	Let's see what [NAME] thought about it...

20	The comments made by [NAME] to Truth on Smackdown about [NAME] makes me really think [NAME] has an outside chance at the win

1	Thanks for the laugh 😂😂
6	I don’t think that many people really thought [NAME] would be a game changer.
27	Personally I'm wondering why our OP didn't go with the clone angle. That's way more insane than them just being sent to prison.
18	I'd love for some kind of throwback jersey game with [NAME] wearing the old-style goalie cage mask ala [NAME].
4	Seems kind of literal

20	What a vile, vile country we live in.
1	Best song about [NAME] honestly, what a bop 
9	That's so disappointing. I'm sorry that happened to you. It really is hard to make friends as an adult.

21	politely? I would hope they break into 30 minutes of laughter then ask no for real what do you want?

17	I like how the Red Tie Legion chose a picture where he’s tieless for their shitty-ass meme.
26	I did Google it, you self-righteous colossal turd, and turned up nothing. So forgive me if I don't trust your hearsay.
4	not sure I agree. whispers of madness can set up [NAME] signature and being card draw is always useful in the first lane.
7	I am sorry but how in the hell is there no added time added ?

4	The minute I heard about this this morning, I just knew [NAME] would use it for his benefit someway, somehow... lol. :/
27	The internet never ceases to surprise

0	That's awesome! Congrats on all the positive changes!!
2	I will never forgive and never forget for this one
20	And yet OP couldn’t imagine a world in which they kept their brownie at their desk 🤔

27	couldnt believe [NAME] got the rebound AND the three
13	And you get a gold! and you get a gold!! and you get a gold!!!
4	I took a screen writing class and I think we had to do this. Then again the class was a while ago so I don't remember much
20	He's a alt right MAGA idiot.
20	Yeah, a 'bungle' given how scummy Restaurant Brands has been known to be. 
20	Went from 0 to 60 real fast, there, duder.
20	This is reddit, unfortunately it's entirely possible he isn't being sarcastic
14	Fair enough. I considered it malicious compliance because I followed the letter if the rules while purposely not following the spirit.
0	The toes stretched out as he hangs from the swinging door is too much cuteness for me
20	You still haven't shown any evidence of racism outside your own mind.

20	Lmao the UBI is just the powers that be making sure they don't have a revolt on their hands once their program of economic alienation reaches a head.
1	They’re trying to escape the crushing oppression of gender roles. It’s not a fun sexy fetish to them the way it is to TiMs.
2	Yeah it sort of sucks now.

5	I don’t think Bethesda is there yet but the next move they make is very important on deciding if they end up on that list or not
6	My misunderstanding, I thought you were questioning why people thought we needed a change.
0	Don't forget [NAME] 3 whole days as an esthestician (or however it's spelt).
8	Re-educated her is more like it. I feel so bad for her. Internally she must be a mess. I suspect she will change her stance again.
6	This sounds familiar. But no it will be [NAME] fault. She MADE [NAME] hurt you for the greater good. /s
27	I wonder how big a problem this really is and what the cops' plan is.
2	You sure are outraged about some people making fun of [NAME]. Gee, that's easy!
1	She’s just not that into you, that’s what I think. You need to find an HL girlfriend and go have fun.

27	What a game.
3	isnt that halloween or like easter, man people are weird

0	Wow! I've never heard of a celebrity doing something so nice
0	Nice, Butt Stallion just chilling in the background

20	That's what I'm speaking purely about. We can only speculate. And oh, yeah, still quality cringe.
20	I shouldn't be giggle-snorting to this, but internally I am.
7	Alicorn then maybe?
25	When's he due? (Sorry, couldn't resist)
4	Problem is that most of the female posters here either do it for attention or almost immediately ghost because they come to their senses.
18	u sound like u need more confidence
20	Now if he does off himself, everyone will think hes having a laugh screwing with people instead of actually dead
4	Ok will do, but I listened to the ep right before I posted this.
3	Racism is as racism does - so yeah, goin' out and willfully doing racist shit is indeed racist. Not too hard to grasp.
1	Lafc fan lurking our sub... lol typical plastics.
20	I would never stay at a hotel that had people ringing a bell at the bar nonstop. Not to mention the gong

20	Tell how your job goes if you do *not* do what your boss tells you to do.
5	as long as the tracking shows delivered, it's not your responsibility what happens to it after that

20	I'd rather [NAME] take the fight at this point, [NAME] looks ready to red mist
25	I regret that I have but one downvote to give.

13	No jerk behavior from kitten but watching people interact with that machine was mildly fascinating.
20	Well I did have one balanced meal...before a few alcoholic beverages.
20	Yeah totally but she was mainly talking about [NAME] coming in and screaming, she wasn’t actually referencing their relationship
2	Nah, I don’t care what these people think. As soon as I’m nauseous, I leave
3	I was thinking that as well after I posted. Some nasty stuff settles on ceiling tiles.

0	Oh, man. The whole story telling methodology was well done, and well paced.
4	Duress I tell you, it was done under duress!! 
4	Isn't that the point though? That's it's up to the people that aren't scientist to decide if the science has any meaning?
20	Makes my butthole clinch
20	They didn’t cite a source. On top of the spelling mistakes. It’s why you don’t trust infographics for stats.
21	Oh man. I had to do it last year. Hopefully my leaders think more highly of me this year.
17	I love that show, that theme song is my ringtone, I never thought I'd see that anywhere else haha
24	_warm and fuzzy feelings..._ Damn it, I'm getting all sentimental again...
5	): hope the goose is okay ):!
20	Looks kinda lame
9	Such a disappointment. Mobile games are such a shallow replacement for a full sequel. What a let down.
9	Doubtful that's why he did it. Which in turn leads to even more disturbing reasons possible. SOS
17	If you feel like venting, I am happy to listen.
1	"My dad makes that joke ""I have to fight anorexia"", his BMI is 31..."

17	So happy for you :)
20	Or saving cows
4	If you ram it just right, you can ram it all night!
4	Well I mean he got erased from existence twice and is still here so I'm guessing it has to be something more than that.
13	Hopefully they got a chance to see [NAME].
10	Blatantly fake.
20	You wont be in pain but you wont feel any relief either. Find what makes you feel comfortable and stick with it
4	I'd love [NAME] to smash some faces in.
17	very long very messy i usually have it in a bun to keep it under control lol
20	Boys lets go start a donnybrook
15	Thank [NAME] for you
21	I was hoping this would be a case of r/maliciouscompliance It was close.
10	and of course if that happens then there's no way it could be true. as if a protester could also be a paedophile.........
0	I love this guy. He does amazing impersonations. Thanks for sharing.
3	Why slum it if they’re giving you actual cost?
20	Meh they got away with the [NAME] murder so they may feel empowered to continue on with their murderous ways.
20	If a crime is committed, you can contact the police and report it.
14	The reaction is incredible. I’m quite certain it’s satire as well, but its impact is depressing as hell. 
5	RTD lines are free in Denver tonight. Stay safe.
3	Be confident when you’re breaking the skin! If you hesitate, the vein is more likely to roll.
7	You wash your hands with hand sanitizer? 🤔
21	But if [NAME] wins... well, things might change.
20	I don't think you understand that the average player can't aim like that on console
17	hello there, i sent some hugs your way. ^.^
20	Oh! Thanks for clarifying. The entire time I thought it was written by a child to their OWN parents. I'm thick.
6	Am I confusing you with someone? I thought you had posted that you liked older women.
1	If that's what you call ugly, I'm basically a hangover vomit that someone stepped on lmao.
23	I think it’s a physical comfort preference having to do with the cut/shape, rather than an aesthetic preference.
20	Just curious, would it be logged on the system if they were accessed?
0	Uhh speak for yourself. Maybe you're just too jittery, I've not had a problem. You simply dont move the stick and it wont move.
5	Be careful with this. This is the same rationale lots of people used to hate on the Covington students.
20	Dirt, glass, poop whatever you dont want on your feet.
0	"Yeah, I was like ""man I love [NAME] so much but [NAME] is also amazing and good"""

11	Yeah until the last one has creepily wed and reproduced.
20	Well there’s a shocker.
4	"Yeah I was waiting for him to coming at the end with ""Why don't you just let us do it?"" I would."
20	It’s treason then.
9	So. Much. *Effort.* I ca't believe a tree died for this sin.
20	Feminists body-shaming and objectifying men
21	if your former manager is receptive in re-hiring you, it's a positive first step. your email is fine. good luck!
27	Can't believe people like this actually exist.
6	Wow either [NAME] misspoke or I didn't hear correctly. I swear he said chainsaw, that is totally different from knife or cooking accident.
3	Fuck [NAME] for continuing to give her a platform.
0	She had the glory of being a virgin martyr. Eternal glory is hers.

13	My poor space bar takes an awful bashing with all the pausing in a Squidge vid

17	Good bot!
20	Then YOU go right ahead...support and guide him.
20	Sure? Money is still being used by them instead of the government wastefully taking it
21	Yeah I’m working with my therapist to help me identify certain behaviors early and pay attention to the red flags.
9	I always feel so bad for [NAME] when I watch this scene.
19	I didn't know of [NAME] before I saw that episode. I fucking love that man and have watched an unhealthy amount of him since.
20	I wasn’t talking about them buddy...
10	Please stop uploading twitter links. There's a reason people ask for/post mirrors.
3	No it’s definitely you. Time for you to grow up.
20	I was waiting for this comment
20	"And when the humane society euthanizes perfectly healthy animals, are they also doing it so that ""people can no longer use them""?"
21	Oh sorry if I seemed dishonest. I hope you can make it through your mourning.
3	When you start correcting spelling and grammar you lose automatically my dude. Your points stand by themselves. Being an English teacher just makes you look like a jackass
8	but the dayman doesn't have the nightman's sexy hands.
20	That was your comment dude. Which part of my comment was fake news? *wake me up if you find it.
12	This is embarrassing, but while purging I wear a pad or don’t wear pants at all. Eating disorders are so beautiful /s
1	I needed this laugh like... damn. This comment is just as good as the OP and the OP is pretty amazing. 🙌
4	Just get on good ol reddit and have the nice people decide what you do.
20	Could he possibly have borderline personality disorder? The push-pull/don’t leave me, please go away vibe makes me think of that disorder. 
3	What...? That’s some real mental gymnastics to justify him assaulting her
9	Yes. The citizen received no “direct benefit or gain”. This is being looked at like someone paying for our lunch.
3	To annoy you That's the real on reason
20	How do I get one

20	Now figure out how to grow bunches like that.
23	Plenty of Aboriginal blokes on here who criticised [NAME] too.
20	Some guys are gonna get their hopes up if you are at all young *or* pretty. You may attract less attention if you can avoid moving.
3	Don't tease me with [NAME].
4	I feel like most of us were pricks as kids
4	Yes it is. But from what I've read it sounds like it was after the testimony and not one of the charges against him.
6	I'm torn between [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] is next man up for scoring now, especially if [NAME] keeps riding the pine. 
20	On [NAME] I’m in Alabama [NAME] pay what you pay and get 179Mbps down smh
20	This is such a dumb statement considering the Rams have benched [NAME] for [NAME] with a ton of success.
20	Imagine this spreading big time, pressuring them into opening the stadium against us so they don’t look like cowards, only for us to thrash them again
9	When they stop showing literally every big Viking loss in these games.
22	I am so proud of this community.
15	I wasn't aware of that subreddit before. Thanks for reading and for the recommendation!
20	Yes!!!! My fam says Amein now.
17	Whoa you are on a big brain level!!
10	And maybe one day you'll be able to afford one, but until then continue being an edgy teenager whining about the war on drugs. 
27	OMG what??? ...[NAME] actually showed up for a gig without cancelling with a terrible excuse?
4	I picked up smoking again thinking it would aid that void that is working. It just made it worse.
0	Lawson’s Sip of Sunshine! Excellent Vermont beer.
3	No, it is full of sexually repressed, nice guy idiots like you
0	Oh wow, [NAME], owchie [NAME], [NAME] to pick one

9	shouldve been a blow out if we made all our FT's goddamit. ill take the win tho.
20	It's not really controversial any year, but he's commentating a game with [NAME] in it. He has the counterpoint right in front of him.
6	I honestly am not sure. I just know that I don’t do it.
15	Thanks for your reply! Maybe I’ll try that game with him and see how he responds.
9	Seeing him give the stone was the only one left in the entire universe, that’s like having a problem (which is really distribution).

11	??? Technically the peso is always in devaluation, also it's not worst right now than before.
20	I've isolated myself to the extent that i only focus my energy on myself/work.as lonely as it sounds its been such a breath of fresh air.
11	What an obnoxious, drunk girl. 
18	Same. I felt like I haven’t found the “right” therapist. Hang in there and hug your little one tight!
4	Yeah, you can. I know people who've done it. Maybe not in your city? Regions do vary.

0	What are you talking about? Anything bad that happened was [NAME] fault - only good things were [NAME] doing!
4	I mean...I'm not saying they did, I'm just saying I would have...
3	Same.. I wonder why we catastrophize over these minor things so much and others seem to be able to forget them..
1	Saying that men have it more difficult in certain scenarios doesn't mean that men have it easier than women in all circumstances. That's ridiculous.
3	yeah, I agree. it’s just annoying hahaha but thank you so much!!! (: 
3	Ah, [NAME] and his random crap again...
3	Ooof. I have a hard time trusting asexuals who declare this information mid elationship.
3	It’s broken garbage. The most broken unbalanced tekken game by so much it will make your eyes bleed and give you a brain tumor.
11	Same! I don’t know how our elementary level colleagues do it. When I subbed in elementary a few times it was awful.
10	> I'll only debate subjects I'm knowledgable of. Then you're not good at debating.

21	Well I hope it works out lol. We really need help in that department

20	This just makes me want sushi.
0	Should you choose to have kids, you're going to make a good parent one day.
2	What I know is you seem perfectly comfortable being a hypocrite but utterly outraged at the idea of admitting to it.
0	Look at that subtle colouring. The tasteful thickness. Oh my [NAME]. It even has a watermark.
20	...and that's just the reaction to them introducing themselves
20	Until they all do anyway and make reinstatement of licensure a condition of return.
20	Yeah I wish they hadn't opened the entire game with the ol' [NAME].
4	Ahh, that's why I love my country.

4	Like the [NAME] twins, I guess.
13	"""Seeeee! We have one of them coloureds too!"""
20	Mouth hugs!
3	It's also complicated because a lot of videogame media outlets quote him
20	That 0.75 is not for the same job. It's looking at the totality of female salary vs male salary.
13	happy cake day
7	It kinda makes sense. What’s the debate here?
15	THANK YOU ROY! i was just about to say, how are they just discovering [NAME] being british.

26	Yeha he failed to qualify unfortnatwly.
1	I don't think you see it in the flames sub... if you do it's probably a joke

8	She shows her face and doesn't hide behind fake names on Reddit .
20	I'm not trying to address the whole issue. I'm just trying to suggest that there might be unintended consequences that lead to even less public discourse.
20	I never understood the real harm until I started reading about childhood emotional neglect and how much it affected me. It's very common with nParents.
4	Free speech is between you and the government. I don't know exactly what Canary Mission is, but I don't think it is the US government.
20	Wasn't that just Age of Apocalypse? AFAIK, [NAME] and [NAME] are married in the comics right now.
23	Seems more first thought is to stop and make sure to call 911.
1	Well I am a lady, so that would probably just freak them out. Oh, Reddit. Everyone is a man haha.

15	Thank you. I downvote all the lies I can, if I like them or not.

27	It was more just “where did all these airpods come from?!” It was weird to me.
20	That is the end-all and be-all of the situation. if you feel upset or insecure you should definitely be creeped out as he's doing it.

10	Personal insults aren't allowed around here. 1 week ban for first offense.
20	Remember: lie, cheat, steal and listen to heavy metal music!
15	I’m here, I’m here! Thank you all!
13	I love [NAME] can’t wait for the full circle version of him
20	It doesn't add up that a person who was receiving threats took actions to stop receiving threats?
21	Usually they dont even show up when you call them and they are a rare sight in the city. Good luck finding one.
12	And I never had the idea to keep anything. Too creepy. Maybe our multiple Liberator pillows....

20	Considering how much they project and accuse how often they others of only hating X person because of their race, it makes sense.
0	Why? He was always brilliant. It was such a shame he lost out to [NAME]. Things would have been very different today...
20	Doesnt have insane standards or anything. I don't see what's wrong?
20	Read the title of this post. I said ugly people can be LIKED. But people don’t truly FALL IN LOVE with physically unattractive people
13	"And the gal and guy behind her. All looking over there like ""whaaaa- smile for the camera!"""

20	Horrible night for dodo
20	Piss drawer. Five bucks says piss drawer.
10	I thought it was 'You are only willing to help yourself'. I could be wrong though.
2	I still hated the system though. I felt penalized for using anything that wasn't the power beam the entire game.
20	Then yeah, not really. I can't think of a specific type of evolutionary pressure that would lead us to developing an ability like that.
20	I sent this to my two friends and one said “haha.” And the other left me on seen : )
4	Ahhh yes the, their all Russian controlled bots play, a classic in the last few years

18	You. I like you
0	Their Cinnamon Chip Bread is also quite good.
9	Thanks for taking this on. My daughter's extended family on her father's side do nothing but indulge this crap and it's undermining everything.

0	Considering how beautiful every single person is, there is far too much ugliness on Earth.

5	I'm not advocating eating the pain away, but bring apples just in case. 
20	Yeah it’s not a woooosh. Unless we’re all the wooooshes for thinking there’s not a wooooshable offense. This is wooooshpaganda.

25	I'm sorry my Baby [NAME] joke made you so angry.
17	[NAME] always makes my day when he's yelling at the refs
20	"Srs it's so bizarre! There's often someone like ""OP is wayyy prettier than [celebrity]!!!"" as well. "

3	Imagine the jockey explaining that to his boss and then cranking the legs to raise it while everyone looks on :)
0	I binged that podcast in about 2 days at work. Amazing. The convention for Limelight, and how emotional they got for those poor women was heartbreaking.

5	Need those thick strong legs to give the boot to all inferior and lesser beings, keep them firmly on the ground while you stand tall over them!
3	You don't follow [NAME]. You're a hypocrite following man's interpretation of the word of [NAME]. Youre too stupid to even be embarrassed.
21	This team + 2 lottery picks and another offseason for our young players will definitely be a playoff team next year.
9	It is a racist nickname because you're literally using the man's race as a means to criticize him.

20	We shouldn't be brigading other subreddits anyway.
26	Not an awful offer but I don't know if I see AD promising to resign long term in Dallas.
20	Shame the 'all in' doesn't apply to managers. He has hired some duff managers over the years.
27	Really? I could've sworn I've seen people disabling comments on certain posts before..

3	They were criticizing your spelling.
23	My favorite is this gem where [NAME] told [NAME] to stop whining and there is no election rigging..two weeks before the election

20	Every time [NAME] opens his mouth...he says the same damn thing.
6	Why is [NAME] out? Is it a rest thing or a minor injury?

9	I can’t imagine being this retired
9	Brutal piece!
7	How do you prove someone is looking for a job??
10	Sounds like a great way to accidentally fucking kill someone who might just be passing by.

23	Says millennials are afraid of hard work, dismisses the hard work required to get a fit body.
10	Her upper lip always looks terrible - such an easy fix, can’t believe she is so vain and never bothers to wax 
8	Something like Chariot will occur again but all electric and highly autonomous. Something I wish [NAME] could do right now.
1	Oh lol. Thanks for the clarification. I just thought that’s the texture of the tongue.
7	Where exactly is the irony? His name is not [NAME], and the title, bio, and picture contain no related jokes. 
4	I was a [NAME] fan for a good bit, so that swayed me a little towards his teams
1	lol what? The worst defense in the league? [NAME] its like we're trying to tank.

11	I'm a Broncos fan. I'll never, ever root for the Chargers, Chiefs or Raiders. Who the fuck would?

3	This sounds like a toxic relationship for the both of you. Seems miserable... I’d hate to be in that relationship
4	Toe boards missing, tripping hazards and netting not in place. You better have a retractable lanyard on that phone. Get back to work hand.
19	"60 young men standing around... ""Look out that old native dude is coming right at us... DEFENSIVE POSITIONS SHIELDS UP!"""
2	I told you I'm not in the mood for a snog tonight!
7	Yeah people used it as precedence. That’s very sad. What’s your point? What abhorrent treatment?
13	Tailed. Let's get it!
21	I hope these young women change the church and not the other way around.
3	Wouldn’t surprise me honestly
5	You okay?

20	I always tried to go first if possible tbh. You're not gonna get away, might as get it over with quickly.
20	No this is what the visitation center said over the phone to [NAME] when [NAME] didn’t show up.

14	I took a picture of a farmer treating his crops with roundup yesterday.. it was horrifying
20	"I thought the army would be like the top image. ""Then why the fuck did you sign up as a [NAME] OP"""
21	Unsurprisingly our closest competitors will try to capitalise as we stumble. Good luck to them, we have brought this on ourselves. 
17	And [NAME] just got laughed off the stage. How things would be different if he had won. Seriously timelines would be so different.
23	I so remember that scene!!!!!
23	"They could have checkmated the ""journalists"" and avoided this situation by saying they decided to switch to only pay for quality journalistic work."

20	Lowkey lyrics right there, revolution or genocide, it won't be televised. Something like that about [NAME] press

6	Is that his real name? That sounds like a Russian [NAME]
2	They’ve changed their mind so clearly they would change their position when scrutinised. Like you said though, he was ignored. 
25	Oh sorry- to be clearer, I meant everyone not on the APP looking for a scooter will get sick of seeing random scooters. 
7	are u ugly?
23	It is incredibly dangerous which is why there are professionals for this, also these professionals use a saber and not a kitchen knife
10	But the guage isn't usable in matchmaking and all items, including smash balls are typically off.

20	Well that's the cool part about ranting, it's to make me feel better, not you.
6	What's sad is that I look like this and I'm not a virgin. What's your excuse?
4	It's about 20 years. They let me out early because of good behavior.
10	If you don't patent, then don't complain

0	Looks like the nightingale armour from Sky rim still pretty cool tho
20	Nothing should be off limits.

4	This is why, when I do it, I'm gonna do it as quick and brutally as possible. This is inhumane.
23	This makes so much sense. Seems she has been icing me. Time to call it quits
20	To my knowledge, Blizzard doesn't have problem with ppl having more than one account. 
2	Let's say he quits or is fired (we already know neither will happen). Who the [NAME] would we pick to replace him?

12	My friends thought I was asexual
3	This makes so much sense. Seems she has been icing me. Time to call it quits

16	I also relate (and regret)

2	I dislike [NAME] more and more. Big ego and small feet.
4	...? /u/iBiteYou I think he's finally gone crazy
20	Not relevant. Evangelicals frequently preferring [NAME] to the likely alternatives has nothing to do with the alt-right; there's a little overlap but not much.
20	Look into DBT
18	Ps mad love seeing that the block has a baestok bighead
3	You basically already know the entire series for how much they've talked about it and how brazenly they spoil it.

5	She was probably suspended to protect her from the angry mobs protesting outside the school edit: here's a better article

20	I mean, you can't be any more in the friends zone if you have a matching neck tattoo with the chick.
20	Feeling better now?
2	Shame on you
11	Oh, fond memories of accusations of belonging to the CTR squad for so much of 2015/16.
26	It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
17	Dude I spit after this comment. I haven’t laughed like that in awhile.
0	Did not know that. Not bad
3	Lol thanks! I thought it was funny but apparently my humor isn’t for everyone.

3	Yeah.... I've always sucked at smiling honestly. I hate it. I hate selfies. I usually don't smile.
20	No, you’ll find her. Us childfree lesbians are out there. 
13	That’s crazy. Depending of the state you’d effectively be obligated to work for that employer.
15	I agree. I was merely attacking the fragility and ineffectiveness of democracy. Thanks for the example!
5	You might want to look into therapy
13	nice shot of that full moon on the first day of winter!
7	I second this sentiment! This has bothered me since the beginning and I don’t know if she really grasps how incredibly offensive this is!
20	Hugs. We put our sweet lady kitty to sleep one year ago tomorrow.
15	Ah, thank you :D
2	FUCKING DIN!!!
10	The reason we’re stuck in the shutdown is the democrats. Plain and simple.
5	"""Grab your Glock when you see [NAME], call the cops when you see [NAME]..."""

0	LOVE THIS!!
3	You can read online if you want. I don't recommend it, but you can.
3	Finding that common attraction or chemistry is extremely hard for me. I can totally relate to this.
20	I'd say more r/trashy than r/insanepeoplefacebook in my opinion
3	What’s so bad about this again? I mean he’s right for the most part.

3	They've done this before. Look the Order of the White Feather up, it was worse.
2	This isn’t a “someone” this is a company.
20	Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the name changes had more to do with legal issues then geographical ones.

10	It’s oddly unsatisfying when someone beats me to saying that.
4	Awesome. But not good awesome.. awesome the way nuclear bombs and hurricanes are awesome.
5	Dont worry about the other people. Driving is filled with way too many other anxieties to have worries about dropping a deuce in a truckstop bathroom.
20	You took the **bait**. Unless you masturbated to it.
26	Oh no, are you going to be psychologically tormented and cry in the shower about it later? 
6	"I tried the pilot and it just felt very ""meh"" to me. Does it get better or is it just not to my sense of humor?"

3	Miz Cracker is the worst parts of Aquaria and Trixie. Unprofessional pettiness and shadiness of Aquaria and the slightly problematic and sometimes delusional humor of Trixie.
14	It's kind of worrying that you genuinely believe that left-wing people are actively trying to destroy their own country. Approaching USA levels of ridiculous viewpoints.
20	It's a gift.
26	To each according to their needs... Except entitled parents, who need everything.
20	But teres an increce in autims retas. With tah vaxenes.

11	Things were significantly worse back then than they are now.
20	Ok then :)
1	hahaha. I was/am honestly surprised that is the only time I've heard of a parent calling a rapid.
9	This show has completely gone downhill, can’t believe I waited a month to be disappointed smh
15	Thank you for your advice! I really do appreciate it and will implement it as the kids get older.
20	Which state? It's actually quite rare.
2	I'm just here to say fuck [NAME]
9	I initially liked [NAME], but he's really kinda dipped in my personal rankings. His shot kinda scares me if it doesn't translate 
20	It was still controversial at the time which was my point.
20	#KYLO REN IS NOT INTIMIDATING
4	I agree with this, but I'm guessing it's because he works from home and can work anywhere while she can't.
4	Anywhere skytrain wants to expand my tax paying dollars will be ok with it.
20	She did NOT try hard, that's the problem.
20	Doing my part

0	Sooooo much upper body strength. My GOD the muscles. He's positively rrrrrrrripped!!
0	Glad to see I'm not the only one with that bug. Maybe someone will report it some day.
20	yeah it really looks like your reading comprehension is the facepalm here from just the screenshot you’ve provided.
11	His video is definitely against the rules.. He literally asks people to spam oh yeah yeah everywhere
6	"""oh that wasn't me, my baby brother must have grabbed my phone"" "
20	I honestly don't know but the more attention something gets the less it gets ignored
20	"""12 inch"""
18	That level 20 purifier upgrade can get so juicy.... i love artanis
1	I cried I was laughing so hard
7	Does negging ever actually work?
7	> freak degenerates who live to subvert all [RELIGION] values and Prods What? Are you for real? [NAME], tell me it isn't true.
4	These are permanent!
5	Can attest. Vitamin deficiency here. Certain vitamins help alleviate bags under my well-rested eyes.
1	This looks delicious, I wish I had all ingredients on hand, because I would make this tomorrow.
0	I dread the day something happens in Ireland, we've been sheltered from the most of it.
5	dear... husband
4	Theres a pretty big Irish population in Edinburgh/ Glasgow as well that'll likely end up contributing to the support.
10	You cannot open or keep it. You can send it RTS.
6	As a guy who plays bastion when the situation appropriately calls for it; thanks, I did not know this.
7	Have you tried finding other communities to join? Now I know ex-[RELIGION] communities are not that common but just non-religious communities should be rather commen right?
3	A cheater is always a cheater in my book.
4	It's pretty convenient
0	Watch it!! It's amazing
0	You’re amazing thank you so much!! :)
20	Trae making sure the traetors don't make fun of his 3pt%
3	Rebalancing all heroes for this purpose seems like a disaster. Would have been good to think about pre-development.
20	The blonde one of the news and yer man off Corrie
2	Those are hoteps. They're delusional idiots; no one takes them seriously.
13	I know! It amazes me every day, but I'm SO, SO thankful for those lists.
15	Damn, thanks for the source!
20	Prepare for trouble, and make it double
20	Lol the actual state of this Nothing wrong with pointing out [NAME] was a cunt snowflake Suppose it makes a change from your usual woman hating posts
7	Why aren’t you using dark mode
4	lmao, have not heard that insult before, that's a good one. Only good thing you have come up with yet and I bet you stole it kek.
0	Amazing. Perfect ending.
20	And riding one makes you look like a man trying to be tough during his mid life crisis.
17	I read this place obsessively and didn't see it, so I'm enjoying it and upvoting it anyway
13	What a finish
3	Incredibly frustrating.
20	I was about to say the exact same thing so I will add Review to the list instead.
20	You were at a casino. Sounds like you won.
4	Because it has rough areas. Which near enough every city/town in the central belt has.
20	No foreplay, no connection, if he doesn't know what he's doing. If he asks for a blow job and then refuses to reciprocate. 
2	Damn, politics *does* make strange bedfellows.
5	Sounds like you are dealing with some difficult mental health issues. Parents generally love their children. maybe try to talk to them??
1	"""Here's your fucking well done with pink in the center [NAME], jsut like youre stupid fucking table wants!"""
0	I'm not surprised. The inherently moral British race will naturally respect human rights, without the need for silly legislation to *make* them do so.
20	Well the last time we got a premier like this, the conservatives didn't get power again until [NAME] and only because [NAME] misstepped at the last second
20	Possible maybe, not at all plausible.
7	Why would you do something so controversial and yet so brave?
20	Right? Go down the street to the next gas station and leave home girl in the car
14	Nothing seems to intrigue or satisfy me only drugs and thats sad.
3	Those eyebrows are faker than my future
14	And I never had the idea to keep anything. Too creepy. Maybe our multiple Liberator pillows....

20	So now we know what it takes to get a wall
2	I haven't confirmed this, but apparently, [NAME] said his trilogy fight with [NAME] sucked because he had an inflamed vagina. 
20	Should of dropped it off at a tor whistleblowing site. 100% safer than this.
20	Also, money. It is a cost-prohibitive procedure for many who desire one.
4	Yeah that pass
0	Nah you just gotta know how to use him. I've had great matches using him
18	I love PragerU r/pragerurine
3	So. Damn. Greasy.

0	[NAME] is a comedian. Every monologue he does is based in humor -- extremely intelligent humor. He is also extremely observant.
4	Are you in Auckland and would you like to start work on Monday?
15	I was having a good day and it still really made me feel good. Had a bad day yesterday and it's still affirming to hear so thanks!
23	I've read the series through 4 times. There is literally zero reason to believe that.
20	Condolences. Take comfort in your cats and breathe. Consider a grief counselor.
15	This is amazing, man. Kick some ass, make good food, get paid. Congratulations
20	[NAME].
23	I thought they would be a little less crazy this year knowing they got their first super bowl but I should have known better.
13	Twenty some years ago, while I was pregnant with my son, TLC aired shows like A Baby's Life. Oh, the old days...
9	I can't believe you would call me that and act like nothing happened. Honestly, what's wrong with you
10	Not really cringey. Its not really embarrassing for you i think people might just feel bad upon reading it.
20	I thought CLA mixed rumors.
17	hey at least you've got a friend group chat
7	Nothing better to do with their time, I guess?
24	Wow. If it shows calls on the bill then what good is it? Glad I asked...
19	I feel bad for that other little girl that was the only one not to get a puck
20	But that situation is not really what you are talking about, is it?
9	Palms had a rough game against PHL. Seems a bit off lately.
3	"Upon the third strike, the ump cried ""Why don't you make like a tree and get outta here!"""
20	Ohhhh, that makes sense. Cheers mate 
20	If she hasn’t told you where she lives it’s too soon to send flowers...in my opinion.
10	Now they say [NAME] is [NAME]? Smh my head
20	So nothing. Nothing happened.
20	only facts mate - so nothing you would be interested in
11	"Yeeeaaahhh.... ""protect""... I'm pretty sure this guy has a rape dungeon filled with schoolgirl body-pillows in his basement."
3	Ah. Yea, the classic loner looking for compliments. Seems pretty edgy
20	You should really contact an immigration lawyer.
10	I’m seeing nothing the same besides the head pose and the hair. Can’t even see her eye look because of those gigantic lashes
10	We don't deserve sex with dogs.
20	[NAME] is the most useless phantom thief change my mind
2	Let [NAME] think about his performance for this 2 week break, god that was a brutal last 5 mins 
13	Wow, after the past 2 seasons that seems like it was like 6 years ago.
15	"That's encouraging. I have similar amounts of ETH and some LTC that's ""pending"" withdrawal from monday. Hoping I get it soon."
4	Have to admit, a completed quest log would've been nice.
20	Not a [NAME] fan myself, but there's no reason to comment on his weight or appearance. It only makes your side look bad.
20	That escalated quickly.
4	Exactly! The mob mentality of these people is sad! Let's bring some love and peace into the world!
20	Kid thinks he’s [NAME]! Mmm... Pound cake...
0	Yea it's pretty fantastic. I got lucky that despite being fairly TBM she enjoys passionate, frequent sex.
20	I've been playing this game since release and didn't even know that!
9	who was it I missed it
5	You spent thousands of pounds on them? They sound kind of dickish to be honest. Find people who obviously value you for who you are.
20	"I can't stop staring at ""[NAME]"". "
12	"""qt 3.14"" made me retreat into my own face, so much second hand cringe "
3	The beetles are under rated millenials dont know what the 60s were if they listened to the beagles they world understand
20	Definitely leave him. However, you don’t owe him anything, let alone a letter. It’s better to leave him wondering. 
23	oh this is gonna go well
17	"Gotta love the ""its a metaphor"" guy, who has apparently never read any other comments by [NAME]"
4	Wouldn't you just enjoy more focus on Celtic football?
6	Is that too bad though?
27	I wonder what number he'll wear since he can't wear 20.
6	Coinbase LOL people think place is the answer. I think it’s Cancer.
14	Violence only begets violence. We'll wind up with an authoritarian despot as ruler if there's a violent revolution.
1	Haha! Toronto, the hotbed of conservatism.
20	[NAME] is such an iconic runway model 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
20	I do avoid it.
20	Vaccines turk err jerbs!
0	Great, another article from a guy who thought making [NAME] the head coach was the answer.
20	> its just there to make people uncomfortable and force a tip. No one working there really expects a tip in the first place.
2	I'm the one who died inside here
20	If anyone believes this post, they are more of an idiot that the op
20	To be fair, [NAME] told her he had a gf. Also, barn girl tried to kill him. Very different situation. 
18	I’d love to flatten [NAME] emotions.
0	Demeaning women is the same as mocking the clown president? Cool.
20	Like what?
15	Wow! That's too real, it touched me! Nice work :D

20	I mean you could be one or a combination of those things, realistically. -_-
3	Such a shame. Her butt was pert, cute and perfect in her Vogue days. Yes, I am showing my age.
14	That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take.

13	This is where the run starts boys!
2	This sub is a fucking joke now
7	Have you guys played Vancouver recently or has [NAME] found someone else to cut his hair?
2	For fucking real. That is not normal behavior for anyone over the age of 15 and it's totally cringey
10	I initially liked [NAME], but he's really kinda dipped in my personal rankings. His shot kinda scares me if it doesn't translate 
20	Convinced me...now let's trade [NAME] for [NAME] and get back to the SuperBowl
20	Or pay someone to take photos. It's very easy to have a cheap wedding if you are a choosing beggar.
15	Your welcome. A simple “thank you” would’ve sufficed. Didn’t need the long-winded response. r/ChoosingBeggars
21	The myth is about selling shirts. Signing [NAME] opens up much more money making opportunities like commercials.
20	Its important that we get members from all over the political spectrum, no one wants a circlejerk.
6	Penis who, now?
15	happy cake day
20	Could be between [NAME] and [NAME] based on Twitter followers

15	Thank you 🙂
20	Can I stay with you if I fly down next season?
6	It's the donuts done brought ya back, ain't it?
10	I'm not trying to intimidate you, just saying that what you are doing is wrong and illegal, and you should stop doing it.
20	"I think OP said teacher in correlation to how he was using the word ""lesson."" I don't think they were an actual teacher."
6	As bad in what ways? The rest of who? Other politicians?
6	We would leave ours up a long time. Cooperate decides when the come down. Maybe that's why.
21	Look I'm not saying I don't understand your sentiment but we really ought to save this one for people openly advocating for genocide.
20	Probably just rattling the people that know they did something wrong, but now you've gone and gotten me to speculate too
20	No, he controlled the match. He had to be dialed in the whole time and he was.
2	Yeah, he does. Just because he draws different conclusions than you doesn't mean he isn't reading [NAME]. Get out of your little bubble.

3	>the silent majority This is the most ignorant thing I've read so far today
15	"I do enjoy how insignificant the belltower looks in its surroundings nowadays. Still a waste of money. Thanks [NAME] of ""Wes-tern Australia""."
5	I'm sorry to hear that. Wish I could be here to help you, stay strong 
20	someone on Reddit said he's like a football expert version of [NAME] on Bojack Horseman.

20	finally, a game to watch
20	I mean nowadays the first grader would be expelled as a sex offender and put on a registry anyway
2	I don't see any shoes on his feet after he lands. Kid is fucking dead.
2	"That sounds like something you would see in some fucked utopian society where if you had enough points you were ""*sent away*"""

0	Good question. Have seen him quite a bit. I love his coverage.

20	Yeah...itd make people's lives easier if I was dead but didn't work out so here we are
20	Wouldn't surprise me if it was an area not too different than what is described in this
20	The dude even looks like [NAME]!

2	**You are breaking the car!**
1	Pretty much lol
4	Yeah just like the Spider-sense, Preflexes can be tricked or only blares up at specific situational times. Bit inconsistent, those two.
5	This child does not understand the economy
6	But how's the breathing through the nose. That's the important question. Can he nail it?
20	The wilderbeast only hit muscles so they patches her up, cleabed the wound and gave her antibiotics

8	It's Incredible! So glad I could help with this! :D
15	[NAME], beer me the strength to make this price lower!
20	🎵 I review you 👏👏 zero bye bitch gone 🎵
10	No! They’re still on the sidewalk right there! With literally absolutely no way around them!
26	I find it sadly ironic that a man's job is to protect his family, yet if he's alone with his children they question their safety.
20	The Morton hockey team train there, if the football moved down maybe we’d have success
14	Omg lol at least now you Will be more careful before throwing out words like that. I would die.
20	[NAME] AND [NAME] ENMESHED IN FISHY SEX SCANDAL!
6	To piss people off probably
10	Which is fair. But they're not respecting you.
0	I'd have to really think about BEST, but off the top of my head [NAME] EASILY is better then [NAME].
14	I would have tactically thrown dynamite and blown my self up about 2 seconds in.
4	Ahhh. A civil and interesting conversation on the internet. How refreshing.
6	At some point you just gotta say, that’s impressive. This isn’t that point. 
13	I’m interested in the tactics and positional play lmao ;)
20	Technically not r/politics. Wasn’t expecting this result from r/showerthoughts.
20	Seems like cutting out the middleman. They already know they are fat so no need to go to the doctor

17	I'm elated to hear that 🤗
7	Just curious as to what got you called racist? Edit: Nvm. You post on the_donald... I can imagine.
3	I would say ask him. Don't read into things too much. Just enjoy. You'll never know if you don't ask.
20	No, those are called natural monopolies. See: particularly the writings of this guy: 
13	Didn’t ruin anything imo. He made one of my favorite films of all time
26	I’ve had a hard time finding stuff in the area, occasionally Construction Junction will have a decent old handsaw or two...

3	>big dumb rodeo Them's fightin' words

0	He came flying out of nowhere for that. I was impressed.
10	You don't even provide a verifiable example, why should I accept your evidence.
15	You can thank the Volkswagen diesel scandal for this...that plate was
22	Havent been working for 10 years at this company about 5 now, but i have overall 10 years experience
2	What the hell are you on about now? Those are some weird examples to go with your clarified opinion.
20	Everything should be there from the Cash homepage... Is there something specific you can put your finger on that you don't like as much?
20	OOF. DEAD ON
11	[NAME] is giving y'all some weird energy. I wish [NAME] would do that
20	Not where I expected that to go...but uh...good luck out there!
20	You called [NAME] a defensive player of interest. I don't know that logic is in this topic.
7	Someone who’s to sad and empty to care about toast... me I guess?
23	In that I should not have posted it or it's just really blatant
10	No. No it isn't. Its a bad sitcom joke.
22	Well I'm glad the whole coffee vs beer exchange was the most accurate part of the episode. When it comes to accents, anyway...

13	Looks like I’m getting an incredibles suit designed for me in this class
1	Seems like it was supposed to be funny.
1	My dogs are obsessed with eating the cat poop from the litter box!! Really gross lol

3	inject that shit into my veins
4	[NAME] looking good for a big game
20	i said first world :)
20	Nah. [NAME] has no chemistry with [NAME]
20	This is the best news I've heard in weeks. Source: Albertan where scum like wolves of odin are multiplying like fruit fly's.
2	SHUT THAT SOFT ASS SHIT UP
8	Would love for us to go to [NAME] and give them Tammy for peanuts with a buyback
20	And how often the Asian guy is the token gay guy (especially since Uncle George came out). What I would give for more Asian romantic leads!
20	Ahhh, I see. I thought you were saying they made you afraid of the sessions.
0	Saw a video on Instagram from my friend that lives in Longmont. The snow looks so pretty. Do want.
8	Oh I gets it. Sort of wished these two guys were more of on the same page.
20	Just don’t buy a sports car and you’ll be fine
2	I can read the anger in this post.
20	Even in Star Trek they have $, they just dont really talk about it. The point is basic needs are so trivial
1	Funny never not will be this.
9	nah he was pretty mediocre at A&M

9	I'm upset that there's no sexual subtext between [NAME] and [NAME] in the new Super Mario game

3	Or you can just support your local farmers that slaughter their animals in an ethical and way less horrifying way.
20	I actually didn't realize that my libido had gone down after getting off hormones, and only noticed it after it reappeared with the IUD :'V

3	Stupid [NAME] is playing into the Church's hands. What an idiot. He has an amphetamine addiction.

0	I like it!
20	They say nature makes man feel small, but I wasn't expecting this
20	You two are IMPOSSIBLE!
20	So, now that his chance of being PM is slipping away, he's going full [NAME] and invoking conspiracy theories. The man is scum.
20	As long as he doesn't ask you to get in there with it, you're good to go.
7	If it's anything like what happened in France, I'd assume because it disproportionately affects the poor. 
15	Interesting, thanks for the article, guess they're just as bad!
18	Sweeter than ever.
20	This will get us focused and we’ll play hard with a vengeful attitude next couple games
26	i swear i've seen this on a poster somewhere at my school, it's awful
13	As a vegan, I can't tell you how happy I am to find any restaurant with vegan options! That man should be showering you with gratitude.
3	He said he says it on his own but I don't want him to say it at all. I feel like their bio mom hates me

4	Yes. You’re both at fault for not getting vaccinated.

0	You are a human, because of off-by-one error*. THIS IS A GOOD ~~BOT~~ FELLOW HUMAN.
4	SC6 has a colourful cast and is actually very easy to get into. So yeah man, go for it.
3	Yep because running a blower for 5 minutes caused it. Not the millions of vehicles or factories we have.
6	Possibly, but not if it actually succedes
3	I understand that there are exceptions but saying a knife is as dangerous as, or more dangerous than a gun is a little ridiculous.
20	[NAME] is a lefty. It's the reason why we had [NAME] punch him out in the division series.
26	For real. I get tired of all the griping. Deal with it or get out.. or start a freaking riot and make changes.
18	They love me!
20	They can’t allow it because then the left would fall apart. The only way you can truly be a leftist is if you believe in lies.
2	I'd also report to the post office... and next time these nasty neighbors come-give them the number to call and complain.
23	 funny, your asking for proof of something the moderators actively remove and then say ShOw Me pRoOf Or ItS fAkE.
1	Honestly I don't care if they're faked. It's an original concept that I find pretty funny
3	I don’t see the MAGA hat kid working to undermine civil liberty. It’s at least understandable to react violently to tyrants.
0	I love [NAME] but hate Royals and wow this version is so much better for some reason.

7	#WHERE ARE THE TURTLES

20	*[NAME] loved that*
20	Can't just GA it but can do A LOT more than pretend it doesn't exist and take it yourself. What a cop-out argument that is.
23	Note to self: always remember to draw my eyebrows on before posting a selfie.
2	Shut up, [NAME]. 
14	> this teams been appalling for a month now They're 7-7 in the past 30 days.
21	I have never gone from almost brushing off something to darn near vomiting because of it, good lord.
20	What are you on about man, those are just rollerblades for fancy occasions 
4	Hmmm. She is Korean. Based on the early posts I didn't see that one coming.
1	Ask her out for date 2, see what happens. Sounds like a fun spontaneous night. 
7	You're being cucked by an MLM I hope you realize that
27	Considering that cheating is a mark of high-status, I'd be surprised if the wife dumped a cheating husband.
15	Thank you. Give her and your other doggie extra kisses for me. ❤️
10	what a strange, sad, moronic 3 day old account...

1	I love how she has no idea what to do. Like stop drop and roll 🤦‍♂️
3	I was pretty pissed when [NAME] was hired for exactly that reason but he at least had worked with [NAME] before

0	Fucking monophanie looking ass floating with the dead, nice.
3	[NAME] is worse.. [NAME] is really bad as well..
20	Grab her testicles

20	[NAME] is a fucking retard whenever he tries to pass forward
20	Can we at least look like we’re trying

8	Yeah I wish they could just finish 9th every year in the conference
5	Well if you're moving to Dallas, it's basically the same thing as Oklahoma and California combined. You're totally safe there!
22	Also, money. It is a cost-prohibitive procedure for many who desire one.
20	Where ever they found [NAME] and [NAME]. It's like a pool of douche bags with underlaying anger issues. Scary AF
11	Integrated, Antwaarps speaking, second generation, not already wearing a scarf back then... unlikely. 
4	if [NAME] got a divorce he would stop doing this
9	All good man, I don't get the college football hate I see on here, and I hate the big ten disrespect I see everywhere.

9	Every time there's a video in my sub box I get really excited and then it's Fortnite. It's heartbreaking.
4	This is so wholesome I love it

20	By the way the dogs also alerted at kuss road but will just ignore that much like [NAME] did lol ciao
18	I would tell her part of loving herself/her body is taking care of herself. Speaking as a recovering obese person myself.
19	I wouldn't get your hopes up until you've been dating a while.
25	I meant it's a sign to others that he is a crypto-Nazi. My bad, I wasn't clear.
20	Well let’s research it. Apocalypse started 2003. [NAME] was 8 then. [NAME] is 11 in S2, so around 2005-2006.
9	You [NAME] did not make us look good at all.
27	That’s how it be
27	The oldest Millennial is 38, so mot surprising you don't know how
2	Get out of here with this, dude.
15	Very insightful and tragic post, OP. Thank you for sharing and raising awareness as someone who has been through the trenches.
11	Just because you lack critical thinking and reading skills doesnt mean i am a moron, it means you need to learn how to think for yourself.
8	I mean it certainly is a ritual so to speak.
4	This is the most fucking sensible comment I have seen in the this subbredit. Have the exact same opinion.
20	> salt rifles. but then how will we kill the flies??? /s im sorry, I had to.
0	This looks amazing omg!!
20	If only they were more like [RELIGION] amirite?
20	[NAME] might've told her when they were talking about [NAME] being on her period.
23	Wow there a lot to choose from for 10 bucks or less too
20	That's not what I said. Re-read my comment.
6	It's genuinely disorientating to witness it.
4	True, my bad. 
10	I agreed with your comment until you told people they shouldn’t be parents for not knowing the difference between deodorant and antiperspirant.
7	Did she do it yet? I refuse to look.
20	I don't disagree with anything there.
3	Clean your room before daddy [NAME] gets home.
3	Nobody would flop like that in practice
4	Are you actually serious? I'm really interested in the details lol
20	Judging by my 10 month old, that is about 2.5 days worth of dirty diapers. 
20	Real. I did it yesterday when there was a large spider trying to hitchhike in my car
4	Except... that's exactly what I was taught in [RELIGION] school. One god, theee aspects.
15	Thanks man, I will have to check it out!
3	How does that work? If in every measurable way, its bread and wine, how can you claim its actually [NAME] body and blood?
0	It's a great article. She nailed it.
9	Yeah imagine if he had been as efficient as the beginning of the season. We would have at least 2 more.
21	Be prepared for many old men to hit on you
23	I was fine until I got to the ICU.
23	RemindMe! 2 months
16	My condolences.
4	The balance above the base fee gets put somewhere else. Education, healthcare, etc. Voila, police aren't biased, people are proportionally fined. 
20	Kinda looks like a boxing coach
0	You know, I'm rather disappointed, but admire your cunning at the same time
0	[NAME] is good but he needs to never take a midrange shot again
0	Is it fair to say she’s the most versatile makeup artist of all Ru girls?
20	I’d burn my hand for nothing if it meant keeping my family alive and safe.
7	Is it weird that I read this with Papa [NAME] voice
3	We have freeish speech. If you can be prosecuted for something you say then you can't in any way that we have free speech.
2	Making a woman feel uncomfortable is harassment and trying to flirt without a sign of interest just makes women uncomfortable
17	If anything [NAME] has shown he can do a lot with very little. The Bucs are just a fun team to watch
20	"Riiiiight... your ""friend""..."
4	“stay still” the best and most timely advice you’ll ever get.
20	Wouldnt believe that much, surely rather stay and win the league first, cant blame him tbh
20	They did that already
20	_Today I felt like drawing [NAME]_
1	Flip him for another 3rd rounder hah
7	I'm not offended. Just curious.
20	the jets have a guy like that
0	What an amazing comment!This really resonates with me! Thanks for writing.
20	I mean maybe I did too but as you said it was a decade ago or more.
2	This episode also had the segment where a paralized [NAME] communicates by farting. So, yes it is the worst. Lisa Goes Gaga is a close second.
2	I AM LITERALLY FREAKING THE FUCK OUT
21	Look at this fancy guy being able to afford eggs.
19	I’m that skinny and have so much trouble gaining weight
20	Hahaha that’s the *all* the tea. I always wanna read the stupidity too bad the mods here are so good 😂 😂
20	Oh look [NAME] piggy backing attention at the end there.
2	Hot take: That fuck up was a million times worse than the [NAME] play.
20	maybe now it'll go up to 3 an hour😎
7	What’s the issue with [NAME]? I think he’s been good off the bench this season .
20	If the cops arrested him, he must be guilty! (Good luck!! You got this!)
23	Oh I should've checked there wow I'm slow 🤦
10	Not really. Everyone has different thoughts about kids and I don’t see it as appeasement.
21	Sorry you’re having to deal with that crap on your birthday. Hope the rest of your day gets better!
10	Delete this. Half the fun is spending five minutes convincing someone to get down on the floor and look through a couple holes.
20	Good shit chivas
20	You two are on lists now.
10	"There is no such thing as ""objectively wrong"", so, no, it's not."
20	Broncos one was harder being state rivals and us being spoken of as possible contenders, only to get smashed after taking an early lead
10	You can't argue that these are the same when clearly one of them has a monopoly over the market.
2	You're not wrong, [NAME], you're just an asshole.
20	Ok, I have to see this thing now.
9	They are so old and so predictable that they can NOT see how “silly” they look when they post articles like this......
6	Why not just bring the county governments back? Let them decide where to establish regionalized schools.
20	hard working, alpha male, jackhammer, merciless, insatiable
23	[NAME] doesn't do nihilism. She's war ravaged. Ergo she has to recover.
7	Why would the family talk about this on camera?
9	Can't help that the president hangs out with the bottom of the barrel.
10	Please no, I have a family!!!
15	"Thanks, I'd never heard this information. Only ""humans have the best endurance"""
16	I'm so sorry that [NAME] has convinced you that his insane aggression isn't important.
19	I'd feel better if the dude in the video didn't have a gun.
9	It feels like it plays worse tbh
15	I did not know that. Thanks!
4	Asking the right questions You can't do that on reddit tho
26	Bags are packed. Have to leave the country at a minimum as it's one of those gyms that's all over the place. Bad times.
23	I was aware I would be going to hospital and would be showing the teacher up (should have mentioned it)
4	Fair enough. But remember, the sooner you spawn, the sooner you'll have that sweet free labour around the house 
20	[NAME] is basically this really cool guy who had some progressive attitudes towards sex and now society vilifies him just for bringing some pleasure to nice young ladies
24	Good things take time.
0	Cool story bro.
7	That's kind of amazing. What a time to be alive.
23	It’s amazing how the r/synthwave sub is just endless remixes of this poster. And the LEGO Movie 2 poster is too.
20	Stocks have less market friction...there is also more chaos due to the amount of individuals vying to make money there, compared to here.
18	I would love you forever! Or dare I say, love you long time!
14	Ill send the dankest of fresh memes so theyll scurry off to steal them
6	> Maybe she was flirting with me? ask her out on a date and find out
15	I appreciate the fact that you used your precious time to translate the meme in Latin.
4	You've shifted the goalposts from first novel to first modern novel... You people always complain that incels don't provide any support for their claims.
20	And even then... It won't be for long.
4	I agree with that, that's really the only reason I play pk too. Probably the reason my win rate for her is 40%
9	That +8 really made the Bucks lose the game today.
16	I have a bad feeling about this.
20	[NAME] needs to be thorough when looking for clues. Who knows what kind of sneaky business might be hiding in that plant.
14	I’d be afraid to get high after that yo
2	Such a sad, angry person. Take a break from reddit and go take up cycling or something.
20	Haha. Fucking banana stand. Didn’t realize people actually used them.
4	Nobody said it would but it *does* fix one problem.
15	Thanks GM & Ford!
3	rather than wait for the site to load, we'll just tell you it didn't load - Reddit
4	I saved it on my memories/highlights
4	Remember they are an ex for a reason. Seeing that smile probably made you remember all the happy times
10	Can someone summarise it here? I can’t get past the paywall.
0	But you appear to think you have some amazing insights on how to handle a pwBPD. Have you considered the possibility that you don't?
0	She’s my favorite too. She is indeed hella cute.
20	What kind of dog is this?
20	Hopefully he gets better and comes back so they can give him a proper roast. :) really heartening to see people come together like that.
4	This would have been a perfect test of those Katyushua rocket water dispensers.
11	Tbh as creepy as this post is I was way more sexually active back when I was 16-20 than I am today Kids are horny 💁‍♂️ Idk
5	> If it concerns you a lot, after 3 times you can actually just register another card. Good idea. 
20	[NAME] is 16 and [NAME] is 19... But she's looks 16 as [NAME] 0.0
1	It's cool.
2	Replace smug with thug and you'll see how racist you are
14	I literally screamed uncontrollably for 3 months and ended up in a mental hospital.
20	 And not all children's hospitals need the same stuff, so call and ask what they need. But I like your tip. You're correct. 
25	Sorry, I swapped back to Canada unclearly, to respond to the comments about it.
0	[NAME] chatting with a kid while waiting to come out for the stars of the game. What a great guy.
20	I just don't get how so many people on this sub know that about the Dems but still manage to get taken in by the [NAME].
20	[NAME] is happy
7	what is cringe about this?
20	Sorry, that was a camel (unless you're talking about the remake).

8	WE ARE .500!!!! I'VE WAITED SO LONG!!!!
10	No, no the PTA has not disbanded!
23	[NAME] should be in. Tough road for Red, but they have been a lot better their last three games.
18	I call even my dog my love (in local language) as a way to be caring to others.
2	This is the single dumbest defense out there for aim assist. This shit is just retarded.
15	Thank you friend
9	Oof, what a bad and dated meme
6	Can genes be altered? I feel like I’ve heard something like this.
20	O R B M A I N
9	Absolutely not. What if a girl did this to you? Instant turn off. She doesn't seem interested. Keep the communication face-to-face at this point.
5	Oh I remember that final , I just dont want to involve my team in the conversation because we share a rivalry
0	Wow. A relevant and amusing Garfield comic.
21	Yeah, i dont know bout you guys, but my parents were pretty anal about my room being clean.

15	omg he could soft feint headbutt into GB thank god i wasnt around when that was possible
14	Don’t worry, [NAME] already added it to his collection.
21	Would it be great if they instead swap around old-rich-guys blood
7	Sounds like you got really lucky bro :). Did you ever see the guy again? If so, did he ever bully you again? 
10	I'm 14 stone...so probably about 2 stone over weight. I don't drink alcohol or do drugs, but I love food....

11	Please get your soy away from me, i’m allergic.

2	MOTHERFUCKING FLYING MONKEYS, AHHHHHHHHGHGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
18	Get a body pillow made of yourself and give it to her as a present when she misses you she can just hug the pillow
9	My mom said that I was an ingrate who didn't appreciate all the sacrifices she made to make me happy.
20	I hope google does this so that everyone would leave them already.
11	The fact that this statement got downvoted shows how worthless some people on here are.
20	Happy Fellow Confection Icon Day!
5	Put a shirt on, this is the internet for [NAME] sake! 
20	OK, I think I can binge and rebinge the entire run 20 or 30 more times before then, PHEW!
0	Amazing shitpost.

21	Okay please share your biggest mistake and let me decide if I fail to see how that could happen
5	Be careful, or he'll have to use 10% of his power on you!
13	Yeah, too many blind assumptions. I'm just happy that we're getting four additional characters to pad the roster with.
20	The definition is simple: relationship -> sex friendship (not f+) -> no sex

1	Ha! I actually included that on purpose, was poking fun at me (and the typical MS3) :)

23	That dog actually looks flatter too.
20	... so we're pretending that this wouldn't be totally awesome had it been 1 administration back?
20	Is this really a thing? I’ve never heard of this in my life

20	Don’t kink shame me!
8	Bruh I wish 😖
21	Now if only America would do this
6	It's interesting that you'd prefer to punish yourself instead of making life easier. I'd do the same with some stuff too

26	>Cars kill more people than guns Way, way more people. Alcohol too.

20	Okay, I see where you’re coming from. I guess I’m a RAW kind of guy so I tend to think that way.

20	"She always says the most basic things""wow he hit him"" and her lisp is pretty annoying."
26	Moonbeam was trash but I am sort of biased because it's 16-17 a gram in Alberta
15	She's only 52
23	[NAME], she said the same laughably ignorant thing about unemployment as you... so you have as much expertise on the topic as a 29 year-old bartender.

13	I eagerly await [NAME] rush meta. >=)
0	Saints Chiefs matchup would make for a great Super Bowl

20	It kills me how much Oklahoma State and Iowa State are able to beat KU but [NAME] and [NAME] just couldn’t regularly get the job done.
6	I'll never understand how people make so many typos in posts that are meant to convey a serious, thoughtful message.

20	This comment is exactly what [NAME] also said about redditors blowing tweets waaaaayy out of proportion.
10	Censoring criticism and discussion is a very slippery slope.
23	We need a bench and a coach that realizes six foot three players aren’t small forwards.
0	I mean, I'm glad that we support human spaceflight and that there were ghosts in the courtroom?

4	So he gave something different? It will be fine
15	Thanks. I'm still sad till this day. But whatever happens, I'm at peace with his decision.
11	Yeah I'm in the same boat regarding DC, its hard to imagine living in many other places in the country for me at this point.
4	Well, flash bangs go bang, too, to temporarily deafen and disorient, so there's that.
3	Huh, Fallout 76 and disaster in the same paragraph....that's not new.
20	Goose don’t give a fuck
22	Honestly this would fall significantly more in their capabilities of being witnesses from an Orthodox standard TBH
20	This isn't cringe at all. He's making a joke.

20	Insulting [NAME] for being captured is good praxis
5	Oh and I forgot to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
11	Nah, [NAME] literally shit his pants in the playoffs. He had to go to the washroom to decompress during a fucking playoff game lmao
6	The dude was absent in the Ohio State game... IDK I would be very worried if he was the pick.
2	Mental games. Take a (mental) shot everytime the teacher mispronounces a word,or messes up grammatically
2	The sea was angry that day my friends...
9	Nah man. This website smells like toast and makes my left arm hurt.

11	I have never gone from almost brushing off something to darn near vomiting because of it, good lord.
1	[NAME] Housekeeper is really funny lol

21	At least now [NAME] has more time to gain his confidence
20	"I believe it was the ""Master Batters."""
27	I hear the ruler's control is remote and is viewed with great reception.
4	This would be cool for a kids science project about conductors and why metal is such a good conductor
20	I liked how in the video the [NAME] picked him up and held him a little. Pretty Wholesome¯_(ツ)_/¯

26	I miss my Shrek Ghrok :(
20	Hey and there are people who drink their urine too. Maybe try that next.
3	Based on that cars wheels it is now very tired.
10	women dont seem to think so.

0	A man of culture i see
18	Ha! I like that one.
20	Or us 2014 babies
4	Well you came to the right place
18	It was nice knowing you all.
20	>[NAME] later admits to his brother he killed me ~~cause he hates bards~~ because he doesn't have the chops to run a robust encounter. FIFY
8	I was really hoping this was real like
15	[NAME] ignored [NAME] and I loved it
20	They are too busy getting murdered and mugged to give a crap about all these vigalantes
10	That isn't entirely fair. We're also for harboring regular ol' right trolls, too.
23	Excuse my wording. I should’ve said [NAME] all around game & unselfishness combined with [NAME] aggressiveness & scoring
5	Still love you [NAME], get well soon :'(
20	Life beat you to it by years
9	[NAME] has been doing everything great except for shooting. It will start falling eventually

4	my favorite moment in the history of the show is when he thrashed that woman.
10	 anyone who hasn't seen this, it's unbelievably bad.
20	Know whats too far? Anchovies
1	Lol those stretch marks are from when I was obese...
23	That boy just learn why you don't mess with a woman.
10	If we can’t even score on the power play pulling the goalie made no sense
3	So you ignored the part I was clearly responding to, though, and decided you needed to explain the other thing. That makes sense to you?
4	We are like the douchebusters!
20	I'd be surprised if mosques make the girls on school trips cover their hair, hence my question.
3	Says nothing about a 2nd interview
21	Maybe he has really bad short term memory, and is genuinely curious how the cop got his attention.
17	Felt like yesterday when they got married in that barn/bar/bistro. Truly the halcyon days.
1	The real comedycemetery is people still posting this joke for the hundredth time
3	Aye the party left me. Now I'm stuck in with this old boys tadger staring me in the face.

20	You could wish for it to cure stupidity atleast. Obviously it doesnt.

0	This gives me life
10	Yeah that was inexcusable
7	[NAME]? never met one those.

7	Didn't he write a dissertation about the pros and cons of finishing college instead of going into MLB?
3	That's just a bad close-out, gotta know [NAME] is bating for those.
3	And yet it looks like one thing you can't is read. Shame shame.
10	Jazz fan here. I completely feel. [NAME] cousins has more votes than [NAME], and [NAME] hasn't even stepped on the court this year
1	I drove off 170 onto 40 and was surprised by the lack of brakelights.... keep it closed haha
1	Lmao all these othr trades happened so I think it's a silly marketing ploy.
18	Tbh I love [NAME] but for [NAME] id be willing to see him go. [NAME] gives [NAME] the best chance he'll ever have of competing.
20	The fact that they didn't double up on gronk on any key plays tells me they weren't playing against NE strength.
4	Sir, this would not be worth watching if he left out the best part.
7	Didn’t they play a game earlier this season with both [NAME] and [NAME] out?
0	OK, I better understand the distinction you're making. Thanks.
13	Oh 100%. And I could see [NAME] & [NAME] both picking [NAME] cause of how she wanted to play the game.
20	Can't be perfect every night
10	No unless it’s like someone you were close to that’s passed away like a parent or something. Kissing your pillow is kinda weird though.
20	You know what’s a real tragedy? I’m yet to find Soleil art with brand.
0	Oh, no wonder I like her so much!
0	She looks so much better. She really is pretty.
11	This series is so unapologetic in its outlandishness that I just can’t help but love it.
20	> to attract degenerates. You frequent r/The_Donald. What does that make you!!
20	I saw that comment and wondered if someone was going to post it here. I almost feel bad. Maybe they’re lonely.
5	When you go get your things, if you can bring a friend. Wishing you all the best.
14	"[NAME] "" haters gonna hate"" the most cringe I've seen of any politician. Worse than [NAME] benefit singing some working class song. "
20	Dont forget asshat.
20	I once described how sometimes my fart bubbles travel up my labia to an ex and he was so grossed out XD
23	Then you're saying its about looks, not the misogyny.
3	Oh don’t get me started about halo, the glory days
20	She already received $750K from the school. And she'll be in debt to the state for the rest of her life.
7	I haven’t actually watched it. Who got featured?
3	Ah damn it.
2	She's reading Canada's extradition act but not Canada's extradition treaty with the USA. I've had this argument before, it's pointless.
2	For serial rapists, its not about the physical pleasure. Its all head games. Damn freaks
20	Isn't it the same thing? Or at least equally bad?
0	[NAME]! Scoring ridiculous goals while missing sitters. Love it :-)
0	i hate [NAME] and 20 good men
1	I have mixed states and rapid cycling too! Super fun
20	It's highly optimistic of [NAME] to imply that [NAME] has a plan. He must be a 'glass half full' person by nature.
4	Rematch against UVA, eh? First one to 40 wins!
19	I rolled my eyes so hard I think I just saw my brain
4	Granted, I dont have a proper measure of the number of monkeys needed to hash $0.05 worth of tx fees.

20	[They've been abusing MPs there-- Facebook took down their
7	Crying? Yeah i like crying C-calling R-out Y-for I-serious N-mental G-treatment
20	The sad part is, they would do something like this. Totally obsessed with Green Bay instead of improving draft stock or the team.
0	They are looking pretty stacked this year
20	Good tips!
20	nothing specific. it varies. it's rare.
7	Picked up my new glasses. Does anyone else feel nauseous after getting a new prescription
17	Thank you!
20	Nay ye can't stop them. Have to let it play out and hope they don't throw a few curse words in there.
6	Right, and the names would be different.
9	Even that game winning kick was close. Our kickers are cursed.
3	Washington had it so easy, until they signed [NAME] that stupid contract ...HAHAHHAHAHAHA
20	Pretty sure that had been upped to at least 10k subs. It actually might even be higher now.
17	Ending a relationship with a toxic person is so freeing. Congratulations!
7	Wanted to see if someone *wood* eat it or not.
21	Oh sorry. To clarify, I was wondering if I should mention that I am more than willing to help her if need be.
1	Hahah wow I've thought the same thing a million times.. Glad I'm recognizing what I've been doing for so long and trying to change now
23	only took em all of the time to realize

6	User name says you are a scumbag [NAME]. I’m confused
2	Soooo.... He basically just admitted he didn’t get his kid shit for Christmas. What a fucking asshole!
2	I feel so stupid. I’ve never made the connection between [NAME] refusing to play for SD and [NAME]
7	What changed that you think it's not as bad? They didn't do anything to the map unless I'm forgetting something.
26	I don't know what region you're in, but it's less than 6 dollars on the WnW website, Target, Walmart, and Amazon!
0	Almost in tears watching him celebrate, true captain ❤️
20	I've been trying to as well, but the game is so scary :/
0	Hedonism at it's finest
1	We're trying to be 3-16 on the road with a positive point differential lol
8	Good for you to get out of it!! seems like a nasty example of narc abuse. No contact!
20	He’s jackin’ him off! Giving him the Bolton Special no doubt.
7	I think womens bodies range widely.. Water, silicone, coconut oil, amounts and frequency needed.. I think these things are largely independent of the quality of arousal..
7	So hard to believe that this comment isn`t being ridiculed. I want some of what you guys are smoking.
20	This guy looks like an extreme feminist with a man’s face
14	"From ""woohoo!!"" to blood curdling screams in a matter of seconds."
20	ISU was missing players and had to choke that game away pretty hard in order to lose
20	Everybody is talking about [NAME], but what about that ball control and through ball from his teammate?
15	Thanks, bud!
0	I hope you meant stay strong, we are here for you. Me too.
2	Ah yes, the poison. The worst part of any poisoning. 
1	In case anyone is questioning...the title is sarcastic.
10	I’m cool with anything that pisses off someone as disingenuous as you.
0	What a wonderful story! Thank you so much for sharing that just made me smile .
26	When that intro drops I get so into it and scare my cat
20	This picture is old af
6	Only if you roll all the windows down....and pay no attention to what I'll be doing.
4	I like that idea.
0	SHE HAS NICE FEET!!!!
4	Okay, diet is important that's true. Do you take any medication? Do you have a psychiatrist or doctor who you see for your mental health?
0	Nice of you to have some social awareness. I’m sure he appreciates that.
0	The pistons are aggressively mediocre which sucks. [NAME] has been awesome but the rest of the team is horrid
6	Seems like the driver in the video car had plenty of time to react and slow down, they just chose not to and overreacted. 
20	Gee...what a guy...
20	And he’s been with same org with his former teammates before Vegas. That and highly doubt [NAME] would drop a loyal player.
4	This blows. But I think [NAME] can do it alone if he gets a home health care assistant.
26	They hated him, because he told them the truth
6	I was thinking maybe she just wants attention and for people to say she’s not ugly.
7	this is less tabletop horror more... regular horror do you know how he's doing now?
20	Have you read /r/NEET ? You'll find that not all people hate being unemployed - they choose to be unemployed.
12	I didn’t think I was implying that you weren’t.
5	Poor horse, must have hurt a lot.
26	That arena is so ugly I’d be scared too
0	Tried that for a year and still scrawny and look young 😂
15	Glad to hear this. Thank you.
18	I love this trend.
10	No. This simply is not the case
22	This is the one picture that gives me mad inferiority complex.
0	I don't envy people who earned what they have. I respect them. I'm jealous of people who are born or marry into money.
24	I was once married and now I live alone. Some weekends, I don’t speak to anyone and don’t go out. Pure heaven. 
4	Yes my mother is ok with it.
13	Thank you for sharing this. I found my house in 1938. Very fascinating stuff :)
5	How scary! She loves you! I hope you are ok.
3	Thank you.. Yeah if she just want to talk she is definitely wasting my time.
18	Hipsters love tapes tho.
20	The StackExchange network might have turned into an elitist playground but it's damn good for finding a fix for your problems.
0	Yeah, I'll admit I like Kuzma. [NAME] does kind of remind me of a less talented [NAME].
2	Is there proof this happened or is it just her accusation? I'm asking because we already know she's a liar.
13	When I was in 3rd Grade, I wanted to sneak into my pregnant teachers house and make her drink beer.
0	Super excited to watch them in Syracuse next year. Might actually spring for season tickets
0	This is so wholesome I love it
0	No credit?? This is the brilliant youtube channel You Suck At Cooking

6	“Am I in the frat now, bruh?”
0	I like it but it’s my least favorite [NAME] solo album because I like his other albums more
7	She’s got time to clap back cause she left the gig early huh?
1	“I am on the verge of exploding in my pants” “Hehe you’re cute :)” -her
3	lmao yes, my reasoned, supported response to your unfounded criticism is most certainly an example of one of the points the hack artist tried to assert
5	Interesting. I’m wondering if nutritional therapy might help her.
20	Crazy when the police are becoming more militarized to deal with threats, you could almost lump them into the 3rd amendment based on that alone. 
20	A royal with creme
2	You are oddly defensive about a random chef. Did you come to /r/wewantplates just to insult people and build up this chef? [NAME]
0	Best kiki dance I’ve ever seen
15	Do you happen to know what time and program that was, please? I’d like to see it. Thanks. 
20	If you are as ugly as you say you are, you're already a statistical outlier.
5	That’s hilarious until you do this to an iced up meth head and you get stabbed.
20	This must have been pre Make Believe. From what I gather, [NAME] doesn't even take tylenol anymore 
1	If anything [NAME] has shown he can do a lot with very little. The Bucs are just a fun team to watch
3	Also his Whirlpool seems to be bugged, sometime it stays for like 3more seconds even tho you don't get any damage from it anymore
10	Curb your enthusiasm theme.
21	Literally no one had to hold her beer. They allow anything on this sub.
20	What u doing dame
4	spurs getting carried away now. Fouling their own players.
20	I would watch just to hear [NAME] talk about how great he is at pinball.
20	Bye [NAME].
16	I feel your pain brother. Just had to put down my rescue pup. RIP blaze it for them!
8	He overachieved my expectations this year. I hope he tops this years performance next year. Go Gmen!
20	“…Don’t try it, [NAME]. I have the (moral) high ground!” 
16	That weighs heavy on the heart, I’m so sorry for your loss
0	Tory nationalists puts nationalstic soundbite. TBH, at this stage, an endorsement from TM should be seen as implicit admission that independence is a great idea.
4	Thank you for your validation. *Kowtows and give thanks the [NAME] way.*
4	Dude my brother just paid $300 for an ounce, can’t wait for legalisation
19	Leader is an aura perk so you can't be affected by it yourself, you can only affect other people with it. 
2	No deal then? Sick of reading about this shite.
11	He was horrible
4	> it's entirely likely that he isn't actually aware of what the current thinking on brexit is in British Labour. Who is?
0	Wow... never heard of that podcast. Looks awesome. Thanks for the link!
19	Oooh, edgy!
4	A joke of a mock and I usually refrain from being critical of other people's perspectives of team needs and such.
7	Why does that matter?
7	whos the killer
4	Definitely.... I wake up at like 3am work at 6am... I hate morning people though LMAO

4	Yeah me too. I understand liking white noise in background for some people but asmr can get kinda freaky at times.
17	Its like a tiny hat. A silly itty bitty hat.
6	Escorted off.. or being detained?
20	Now this is a gem.
20	which is the fault of the people they voted on :D
4	After dating 2 of them, I can say I fully agree.
11	I hate those days man... So triggering
23	He had a poor year in 2000 but a really good year in 1999 that helped the Mets make the post-season.
21	You are a human, because of off-by-one error*. THIS IS A GOOD ~~BOT~~ FELLOW HUMAN.
21	Good luck to you darling. I hope you feel strength and happiness.
15	Well done, OP. Thanks.
18	I love tropical weather, it's the endless ocean and moving ship (I have bad vertigo).
23	It is amazing how social media is allowing maniacs to congregate. Social media is very bad for us.
20	Sorry don’t follow you.
0	Awesome!! Also, I have those same markers!
7	No it’s ok. How does [NAME] feel about his mom hovering? Are there plans to move out or is this a permanent thing?
17	Majority of [NAME] support Dem investigations of a foreign agent? I’m so proud!
20	Why are you nervous about getting fired if you aren’t doing anything wrong? If I were an employer firing an employee would be my last resort.
4	I admitted to myself that I had no other reason to think [NAME] was real. Kind of tough to stay [RELIGION], after that. 
0	What a career for TBA. Started on the wing for Qld in 2002 and now playing at prop for the Indigenous side 17 years later.
20	They might if there was something to eat in the middle :s it's giving me shudders just watching it :S
6	That's a very...unsettling face.
27	That's literally insane considering we're talking about [NAME] and [NAME].
11	Will be interesting to see what happens next, one thing for sure is [NAME] won't just fcuk off, you can't get rid of the woman
0	It's near Brooklyn. Very woodsy, couple nice little antique shops. Most definitely the middle of nowhere.
20	Ours go insides and zones random isles.
6	I am legitimately confused as to why don't they do what Warhammer does with its video game licenses.
20	Sacrilege! :-P
6	Is [NAME] up to his neck is dodgy dealings again after RHI?
20	Oh, the boat was already on its way out lol
9	Nah, reviewable offsides is pretty bad
20	Blind kid throes better first pitch than [NAME]
3	There is little attempt being made to protect native-born people from the negative effects of mass migration. If you think that is morally correct you are insane.
0	Yeah, I know. I was kinda hoping you didn’t. Ya know just for the point of what a great salesman this dude was.
3	HR is there to protect the company. Not you.
18	"[NAME] IS SO CUTE WITH THE ""MINE"" SdgksadGDKLSG:"
0	I’ve seen him on the facebook page! Thank you!
3	you have zero evidence that anything in this story is fabricated. your blind cop hatred just really, really wants you to believe that.
10	If you are a [NAME] and he is a real person, then changing his ethnicity should be an issue, right?
27	And so are you!
11	Disgusting trash feminazis, fuck your hijab

23	Haha, willing to sacrifice eternal paradise for a taco. I'd make that trade, straight across..at least the taco is real ='D
20	say it with me now super star
10	This would be better posed in r/GCdebatesQT, thank you.
2	Now that’s wild
2	You get her off 3 times and she doesn't finish you? That seems very selfish.
20	Tell your husband. Its lies by omissions. Who are you to pick and choose what HE wants to know.
20	> I feel the big man deserves some love. Because people on places like /r/pcmasterrace doesn't treat him like the second coming of [NAME].
1	Bro, put water in the microwave and see what happens, we're like 70% that shit
10	Most GH now is fake. The real stuff is exorbitantly expensive.
1	Thanks a million, because I was very much thinking the opposite hahaha
21	You're very welcome, and I hope it's the hardest thing you ever have to do--meaning I hope it's all downhill from here. 
23	and this is why I, having been baptized [RELIGION], choose to be cremated after I die because I am sacred and can, finally, no longer be used
13	OW MY LEG!
20	I heard about that too
11	[NAME] here...that guac looks horrible

6	Ugh I never thought I'd be someone that gets jealous about shoes, which ones did you get?
4	I get hard in the morning from just standing up and my body not knowing where to put the blood. But any other time of day its always sexual
15	Always and I appreciate your opinion good sir
20	No one asked for that honesty.
15	Thank you. Yeah this makes sense too. I could be blaming myself more than I should
6	Can you explain what you mean? I read this as you would allow someone to insult, emasculate and demean you. 
20	I think he was saying Canadian eh, not a meh type eh.
13	Wow, I wonder who's going on about Tahiti in the background.
20	^ [NAME] idiot squealing
2	Get out now!
9	Done and done in the memory of [NAME]. I am sorry for your loss.
4	Because the people pushing the myth are either willfully ignorant or outright malicious.
10	OMG! I can only imagine. I've gotten it into a hang nail before and that was NOT fun.
27	Holy shit he hit him hard
9	[NAME] didn't contribute anything! [NAME] or [NAME], please come back. At they least you do something on the court!
26	I stated previously, the one knock on [NAME] is his lack of counters. That’s what separates him and [NAME].
20	Kind of hard to give consent in a coma.
4	Possibly. I just couldn’t go any further with it. Not after that.
20	Turns out they weren't wrong about [NAME] either
20	Last email i got was on Jan 27th on Sunday @11:22PM which is really odd imo
20	Once you get to great great the odds go down for unique male ancestors though.
10	How about we get no wall and Medicare for all. Then only the good ideas get funded.
1	Rule number 1: never dye your hair while drunk haha
20	It’s so easy to go on killstreaks in the prequel maps except Geonosis. You just suck.
21	Meh. If someone wants to find me, they will. Of course, they may not like what they find, or what I can do in return.
4	It's legal now in quite a few states. People get booze for Christmas all the time. I'd be stoked.
26	Definite Fridge Horror moment for that movie. That poor man.
21	So, I'm wondering if there's something I can use for this project that will help you if it's solid.
24	I was homeless for almost 2 years, so it's something I feel very connected to. Not a circle jerk for me.
20	"""Should be"" being the operative phrase. Not happening at my store."
20	Does that have any bearing on as to why cats are preferred over dogs?
20	It’s grandmas house. His house is a tip
9	I also remember the scripts stating [NAME] look was one of jealousy, which disappoints me.
4	Honestly never seen one as dumb as this.
20	TrollX doesn't appear in /r/all; mods made it that way because we kept getting brigades of shitheads every time a post got remotely popular.
4	Lots, play store or apple store vpn. Nord is good
20	After she hands [NAME] the nomination ;)
2	This makes me unfathomably angry.
9	Dude, I've gotta listen to Loveless again 
22	Benzos stop working after a few weeks because they’re very addictive and tolerance grows quickly. I use them occasionally but never more than twice a week.
2	"& when you call them on their shit they ban you from their subreddit for ""oppressing people"""
0	Just eat it after. Lol. Im kidding, but it would honestly be the best recycling option. Not that anyone is going to do it. 
5	You okay, buddy? 
1	Dark humor is like food. Teenagers love it and prefer quantity over quality.
21	Truly a blessed day for you! Shine on!
4	Yes, in my opinion they are perfect backcourt fits. [NAME] weaknesses are [NAME] strengths and vice versa
20	That’s a straight up ghoul
0	Love scary podcasts at work. Thank you!
17	Luckily every elevator would be broken at all times.
1	Hahaha dude that was *so* well put
4	That's true, you'd imagine it'd have come up beforehand. 
4	I'll message you when I have the time to play! :) Ty!
4	Def ok if we lose this game but its close. Every loss is a win!
17	I may have awful taste, i would want this cake
16	The only one to really be sad about losing is [NAME] tbh
4	No doubt would start at wing. We need help there and it would help ease him in
20	an interesting trade would be [NAME] and a 1st to the Mavs for [NAME]. and [NAME]
20	Now that you put it that way I can’t un-see it.
0	Seriously, I’ve been catching and loving this one since it first came out.

0	old school from back when we won the cup
0	That's an interesting way to do it. I might come off as a little crazy, but this would definitely be an interesting experiment. 
17	The real tips are always in the comments :D
20	This kid in the future
20	Oh my [NAME] why did I look
3	> Not necessary, you're a visible enough asshole that you pop up naturally.
4	The only rank that can't be deranked is diamond. However, all rewards are based on peak elo. So don't be afraid to keep playing.
10	They’re letting teams get away with murder then they call [NAME] for that little touch foul. I don’t get officials.
10	[NAME] has a player option next year that seems likely he will likely decline to secure a new contract with more guaranteed money.
7	Is this a real question or a snark?
20	[NAME] with the beautiful backtap
0	It's both we only have like 5 good players and two of them are just a rookie and a sophomore
20	Are they jealous that they are playing a better sport.
20	[NAME]. Was that the reason you broke up with him lmao
2	You'd think, but people are given a lot of leeway. Hell, in the South, public schools are allowed to spank children.
4	I got to see some fish at a science museum not long ago and it really brightened my day, too.
13	i got kangaroo from the meat guys over in U district at University Seafood and Poultry. they have tons of exotic stuff

18	Mmh, I love the smell of thought policing in the morning. 
0	Very good post brother you hit the nail on the head. It is unfortunate that people downvote this post to the bottom when you explain so well.
0	They might be giants. Anything, but albums John Henry and Apollo 18 are good value.
20	The adults are a bit drunk and I just got called an anti social bastard Pray 4 me
14	To be fair, they did call it a horror. 
20	Delightfully devilish, [NAME]. 
20	Teleport, people forget you need a mask in a bank safe because of cameras, so put on a mask :D
18	I loved this place but I would only go for the big Blockbusters. It was the best IMAX theater in Minnesota hands down RIP
23	> Same guy that was saying about this time last year that using P2PKH was harmful to Bitcoin and people should use SegWit. Liar
20	This is reminiscent of when we thought we were lucky that we got [NAME] AND [NAME] on our staff.
14	I know, I know, but CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR BEING NERVOUS
20	He's just keeping the pieces warm for you.
20	I was just busting chops. Glad to hear your health is better. I think you've inspired a post on r/intj my friend. Stay tuned.
20	### Because Shaggy IS such a powerful being
20	Oh poop I forgot about that. My poor buyers :(
1	thanks! yours inspired my to post mine lol
4	You're right. Respect and honesty has never changed for me, though I realize that's naive
0	I'm divorcing my narcissistic ex and that book helped me so much!
4	That actually doesn't make any sense considering many college students work outside of school.
20	Ask the murderers.
7	Did you know your post about your comment being downvoted is also being downvoted?
6	Why would the landlord pay it if electric isnt included. Sorry to OP, need to cut the heat down
0	It was. I accept that, and it taught me a valuable lesson.
20	The guy with the camo comment is correct. r/woosh
20	Which one?
18	I love [NAME]
0	Yes!! My favourite film - I came here to suggest it, too. 
20	[NAME] a fucking idiot and needs to be primaried out.
3	Damn, that's low. 
20	He means they may be down atm
0	Oh man. GOOD one.
3	I lived for your comment. I'm a goofy goober, yeah. 
20	I love how when a girl flees saudi arabia in fear of her life she gets called a drama queen. This right here is a drama queen.
4	[NAME] is from the Bay. I'm sure he believes [NAME] is the greatest of all time as well.
4	If the kid knew what she had on her mind, he's been corrupted way too young..
3	Someone who's done very little to earn your ire. Did I piss in your cornflakes?
23	It's too bad that you think helping out the less fortunate is sad and make a joke about it . People like you are the problem.
3	Shit okey I think I’m ready
3	The most hatful crowd is not the lefties. Lefties may be annoying but hate as such is a tool used by the right much more skillfully and forcefully.
20	[NAME] is such a wholesome woman. The world needs more people like her.
2	[NAME] BREAK THE GAME. WHY HAVE YOU GIVEN ALL THE KILLERS A FUCKTON OF THEM. ITS SO DAMN STUPID.
17	Wow, I’m going to have to remember this one...
20	As a killer main that sounds like bs, and makes me even more likely to treat 3v1 as a fun round
4	No wonder they don’t want us using the word “retarded”...it all makes sense now
20	We should strip [NAME] of his Stoney badge for being so soft.
20	Blind kid throes better first pitch than [NAME]
13	Slovenia is awake and ready for some Mavs magic!
2	She’s cool as hell
10	Nah, I got married in Texas about 20 minutes after I got engaged. 
20	Oh the irony of the sweater she's wearing.
0	I recognize this YouTube channel... They make beautiful furniture. This has to be at customer request. I have no idea how to explain it otherwise.
22	that's a proud dad
4	This! A while back a girl on here said that “the ed is trying to trick you to keep itself alive!”
27	Top female players including [NAME] practice against college men players and get beat a lot by them. I wouldn't be suprised to see [NAME] win even at 14..
1	Thanks [NAME] for winning so we don't have to see so much of [NAME] laughable career dwindling away.
5	[NAME] bless you
0	Yeah I had a lot of respect for him in that moment.
20	Wondering why they change it
9	why are other dashers such [NAME] 🤣who made y’all so upset
15	This sounds hard, but not too bad! I'll try some of this. Thanks!
23	Sorry, realized I hadn’t answered the question lol. Was typing that when your response popped. 
15	Congrats! Wait till you get your first date and you’ll feel even better.
11	Hate them. I really don't need to hear about you pissing your pants in the first grade.
20	Wait. Mr. [NAME] was in Got!
5	Just be good and you won’t lose, ez
4	Fair enough. Thanks for the input.
20	That's gotta cut deep!
11	Out of all the seasons I definitely feel the worst for her
20	When they tell me “oh my [NAME] you don’t look 22, you look 15” 
17	.. :< you're welcome ;;
20	The film room crew think he'd be first qb, but top drafters don't need qb
9	Virtually no happiness anymore, exhausted with trying, meds not working properly and just tired of it all.
8	Yea he does I only wish eli could do this
7	Are you saying you did not expect those bananas?
0	He looks like a toddler who got to dress himself.
20	i was in that thread, but i can at least admit it ;)
20	There’s no reason to scare a parent into vaccinating their child with all this crazy talk of measles and polio. Everyone’s right!
0	I love this pic... believe me I am up for some reason my hands on you.
7	Will they ever stop?? FLG is a cult.
0	Great Expectations!
3	Watch the FO not sign anyone. That would be the most dodgers thing ever.
7	Where's this snow everyone's talking about? Just looked out the window and there's no snow here.
20	*nods* I know an unfortunate reality. I was presuming that he isn't in a situation like that based on what he said though.
8	I think [NAME] is the best QB Prospect since [NAME] and I would kill for my Lions to get him.
2	You know all politicians do this/have done this or similar things to their own compensation, right? Hate the game, not the player
20	37 here, happily single. And the majority of my friends who got married at 23/24 are getting divorced now. 
1	Pistons gonna have to part with something the fans don't wanna give up. Haha
20	I hope you're ok, I feel this post :( big hugs from me
26	Sad truth is you cant run away from who you are no matter how hard you try :(
20	Done Please spread the word. Invit your friends
20	Are you interested in hearing from men and women?
1	Lol love it.
20	Eh, it's very easy for him to show up and offer guidance to the NJO (or whatever happens) IMO
15	Wasn’t around during Freelyread’s time, but I’m only hearing good things here. Come home Freelyread. 
20	No.
20	To be fair, all of those QBs may not have been starting quality but most of them ended up being solid backup else where in the league. 
5	[NAME], he’s who I’m most excited to see develop 
25	I have regrets. But I am trying to make the best of the situation.
4	He was! And people in my class would be so hard on him about his accent. I hear the guy teaching the class now is really good, though!
20	[NAME] FINALLY fournier, [NAME]
0	It’s irreversible, we’ve started something bigger than we know.
20	No. Utterly despicable cult with no redeeming value.
20	You'd think that's a simple game mode they'd have had from the start... I would have loved that.
6	So what's your point? It's colder today than it was yesterday. /s
10	For cart pushers, I can’t recommend getting good winter/rain gear highly enough. Good socks and waterproof/resistent shoes will make a world of difference.
10	there are [NAME] and [NAME] accounts too that's like this. I've started blocking them all upon first sight
20	i hope this grossed u out ur welcome 😎
11	Oh wow. That sucks to hear about [NAME]. I guess not uncommon with a bad family life.
5	Wow, that crazy. Hope this doesn't happen again with you. Stay safe!
20	Wait a minute
13	Best picture of this I’ve seen so far!
3	Sucks to suck Ratbirds
20	Live out their Shonan Anime fantasy of being “the one” without a proper DM to tell them no.
20	Omg I thought he was actually fired lol. Got excited ! I still approve tho
0	The perfectly timed dessert, and delicious looking, too!
21	I wish they had what they advertised. The end of that era was sometime in my teens.
3	I don't like [NAME] she is not relevant to the series.
17	Makeup is magic my friend!
20	the socially weak kid who is also: - neurotypical - not too short - not too ugly so basically a normie
4	[NAME] is an unrestricted free agent as well
20	I was thinking maybe she just wants attention and for people to say she’s not ugly.
4	I’m not. I know too many moid larpers to be one. I’ll show you my face if you want.
20	YES!!!!
18	I really love how this team responds to injuries
20	They're basically our version of [NAME] and [NAME] at this point. Every video seems to involve a dumbass rant that misses the point of the topic.
3	we stan supportive parents!
4	This is delusion beyond what I'm willing to engage with.
21	Also a possibility.
20	I believe if he did (and she didn’t) then he SHOULD be in even more trouble. They can easily fact check that.
20	Yes he is. He won me with his beard alone 😍
0	Great album! 👊
10	That’s not cool
12	Gotcha. I see my clarification above. I sincerely apologize that anything I wrote made you feel that you needed to enforce your boundaries.
20	>Sorry, but any city that had any kind of ~~epidemic in its~~ history will have bunches of dead people buried under it.
3	Whoa I actually remember this. Wait shit does that mean I’m old
23	Got my Crass tattoo in 1987
20	Not to be the joke of the entire league
17	Glad to see Tael (wabi) on the list but surprised its not at the top.
16	We are killing this planet
20	This game is on [NAME]...
1	So 7 years of playing the game (started playing at 15 and is 24 now). Ridiculous.
20	just wait till you get to PLO8, the final level
18	I once hi-fived the GCS mascot and loved to tell the tale, [NAME]!
20	Twas a joke ❤️
20	She had her chance. 🤷
20	Man that was a long of run on sentences but whatever.
20	If you want BCH to be successful on its on merits you have to vacate this subreddit.
20	A cat at rest will stay at rest until it wishes to engage kill mode.
20	I saw [NAME] recently with [NAME] and it was bangin
3	It's like they have no self-awareness, and they just engage in ridiculous hyperbole and expect to be taken seriously.
20	She's still looking for her [NAME], maybe? :)
11	*She. This was posted by a woman, apparently. Its just as disgusting either way though.
20	Oh I know just bantz
20	I like how bro is just underlined for no reason
0	Best comment ever.
18	I love her face in the second one. Embrace your waiste!
4	Honestly if you had to live in punchbowl you’d be angry too
9	yeah i am using the regular blue black deck. But is it really that bad.
15	Thanks, we were kinda enjoying it at the time too
0	Ah, our primary investigator picks another hole with his salt mining tools. Well done.
6	Only six colors for this look, sweaty? I could do the same look with sixteen.
20	[NAME] as a coach. That definitely doesn't make me feel old.
20	Me . Switched to badminton meantime.
20	Right, seafoam. High of 16c today! There are always nudists at the beach, it seems. Not many, but a few hardy ones!
20	Whiskey isn't going to help. She should pray to [NAME] that another man comes and brings purpose to her life.
20	I do prefer achievements to trophies though, but the platinum is the only thing I envy PS users.
8	I'd like to see it set during the [NAME] conquest of China, That'd be cool
4	That sounds kinda crazy. I bet you voted for [NAME]
5	Have fun.
10	Another episode of idiots with guns
20	Omw. When my man sends me that I get all warm and excited cuz I know I get to spends the next couple hours or days with him
10	I think a budget PHD or DNP would cost me 35k so not happening.
20	Careful! They're trying to steal yer Lucky Charms! 🎶🎵 *they're magically delicious!* 🎵🎶
20	Just ride the subway in NYC and watch how everyone behaves. Don’t stare, though. 
3	Call me cynical, but I wish things wouldn't go back. That's why I like Infinity Wars as much as I did.
2	Are you serious? Open up a fucking history book
1	Haha fucking gottem
20	Insane dva player nice
5	You should have asked her out. It would have made her feel better after that and you might have scored a date.
0	Wise choice. You had kebab.
20	Speak for yourself. Our defense crumbled under incompetency despite the talent they had to work with.
14	That's your justification? You're a terrible person. Correction: You're a terrible child. Get some help.
5	Oh poop I forgot about that. My poor buyers :(
15	Ugh. This is horrifying. Thank you for sharing.
18	Nobody forced [NAME] to take [NAME] over [NAME], if he liked him that much then he should’ve just taken him.
1	At some point in the season the whole bench is about to do it lol
15	This is the first time I've finished something so cringey. I'm dead inside, thanks. 
1	"The ""awesome"" shipping service that promises 2 days but still takes a week? Lol"
21	Looks like backyard [NAME] and the gang have a new member... [NAME]!
18	You can find the light! Maybe get a pet to love :)
13	Really looking forward to Mayeather coming out of retirement for the 5000th time
20	I wanna add on that the perk I was talking about is on the dagger from the pack, which you can get standalone for 250 helix points
1	"""AaaaaAAAaaaAAAhhh!"" I can imagine."
15	Nah I'll be right thanks [NAME]
1	This looks like an obvious joke to me. Most of you are getting baited.
4	They've provided plenty of evidence that you have only supported so far.
4	Or wait a few more weeks and try to snag one on sale after St. Paddy's
1	LOL thank you for this, it made me genuinely laugh. They're so weird
15	We don't deserve you. Thanks for the update. Happy it's being handled! :)
11	That’s horrible. You definitely didn’t deserve it. I’m glad to hear you’re doing OK now.
3	Justice for that horrendous no call
20	Isn't this kind of what America is all about
24	Ah well I still feel a bit bad for the parrot but at least he won‘t be harmed :)
2	What? Shut up?
20	BONE-SHAKINGLY MEDIOCRE BROTHER
0	Did it taste good; I bet it tasted good.
20	NFL level catch
0	I came here to tell you that this wins this sub and I’ll never be able to finish reading it.
20	Ehh, still pretty ambitious lobs for [NAME] though. I'd get it if it was [NAME]. 
26	Didn’t know if you knew, so I was just trying to give context to your statement. Sorry. 
21	I was considering making a post with the same sort of thing. Good luck with the hunt!
15	Thanks for the support
20	not worrying about being condemned to eternal hellfire for it takes away one impediment.
20	There's a ton of reasons in other threads.
5	You will need power by it for the bolt to the level where you want to cut a bit easier to avoid getting it on the box!
27	> The headline writers are misrepresenting her words (second publication I have seen in minutes that has done so). Oh wow I wonder why
18	I'd love me some JVG, but not that [NAME] freak [NAME]...
3	A little optimistic to call it trolling. He's pretty Damn stupid, let's not put anything past him.
20	> I think [NAME] is the best QB Prospect since Luck 😐
20	My names Welsh and only 5 letters and even that is too hard for most people.
21	2015 was a year where either player could have won, and they'd have a pretty much perfect case. 
5	CONGRATS! So happy for you. May life treat you kindly from now on.
21	I don’t set an alarm I naturally wake around 4am. Love my mornings.
3	I like The Office but this seems a bit weird.
18	I love the Nets
7	How did you get them for free?
20	I love the twist you did on the “it’s all gravy” idiom. Definitely saving this comment to refer back to when I need life advice
10	That's exactly why I think it would be a bad idea to scrap the program wholesale. Though, I still think that stadium is ludicrous. 
20	That [NAME] cover though... Turned over to [NAME] at that point.
7	Is this strictly Denver, or for the metro area?
1	[NAME] just played her ass...hehehe
2	Nashville as a whole is easily one of the most classist, racist, judgemental, prejudiced cities I've set foot in. 
20	[NAME] and [NAME] had equally good chances when they were on the same line in the first/second period - they just didn't convert.
3	Nope. Don't need rewards at all.
15	"""Thanks for showing me your red flags within the first 10 seconds of interaction."""
1	LOL thats right, your wait for someone to hand everything to you. LOL
0	Aw thats so sweet A loving cimmunity is what [NAME] and [NAME] deserve for giving us such amazing content every day
15	Thank you so much
5	[NAME] has always favoured [NAME] so I'd assume this means he's the next up, I just prefer [NAME] and find [NAME] a little overrated.
12	I don't know what's more embarrassing, the fact I watch the show or own a Roku TV.
23	He reminded me more of [NAME] last year. His lumbering skating this year makes him look different.
20	But asking kids he teaches about him and then telling us that. Weird flex
23	NO absolueltey wrong. WE MUST PRIORITIZE GETTING CORPORATE MONEY OUT OF POLITICS OR WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SOLVE ANOTHER PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.
20	This is one of the identity issues I was referring to in my original comment.
21	Don’t waste money on guns, you’ll be given all the best guns in the story
25	Eat too many whoppers and he'll be down with the sickness. Lma0 I'm sorry
15	thanks for the warning :)
23	i think it is characteristic for la liga, in germany that would be atleast +3
10	Interesting. I’m very against the death penalty.
3	Look! More complaining about people complaining, thus compounding the issue! What a happy little circle-jerk : ) You guys will never stop.
26	I have cried in hotel rooms before thinking about the loss from discovering it is a lie. It's tragic and wonderful at the same time.
18	Homegirl has been my favorite since season 1. Just like [NAME] on Laguna Beach. Maybe bc they remind me of myself. 😬😬😬👀👀👀
0	You had great seats!
14	IMO there are quite a few jobs that are criminally underpaid, but that's just me.
20	From super smash bros melee?
1	Haha this dude’s from the area I’m from. He’s a local treasure
3	Well, that was dumb.
3	He has been horrible in pull up situations but not horrible with catch and shoot this season.
6	Cool, yeah I feel I’m too old for college girls and too young for more mature women. But gotta work on myself for sure
9	They're on the list, still have a few of these to knock out 
0	Dude is really nice. But I’m gonna be so upset if we ignore our huge need for a small forward again.
4	I saw it when it was at the Mackintosh Church in Glasgow, it’s pretty impressive. 
14	Wall St is scared of the 2020 Democratic primary.. Good!
4	Yes he is a hard worker for sure. Just wish he could get his shot back on track.
7	I played in the WSHL last year and this really isn’t a surprise. It’s crazy how unbalanced the competition is in that league
1	I laughed way harder then i shouldve
22	I'm 21 and I've slept with dozens of girls.
10	Just report his comments let the mods take care of this misogynistic twit
10	Hitting me. That just added another funny dynamic to it even though I wasn’t actually trying to hit her.
20	Casual uber ad
4	All the best to you truly. I hope you can find balance in yourself which is what we all secretly need
21	So America and the USSR are the exact same thing to you? Sorry you're so small minded, hope you learn to grow in the future.
5	>Her obsession with “her man” is weird as shit though. He's jealous. He still cares about [NAME].
2	"Yeah like ""oh yeah? No shit?"""
20	I want to see more heroes just kill villains. I’ve been playing Tales of Vesperia and got to THAT scene and it got me super hype
20	ok i noticed the eyelashes but the rest is really unnoticable
10	That's not fickle. That's insane and delusional. It's not some cute little quirk. It's a disconnect with reality.
20	When you feel bad, remember his comments on [NAME] throwing the shoe. He sucks.
13	Happy real life cake day my dude :)
0	What a baby...
20	As a teacher it would be lovely to eat lunch in this room instead of where i do. GTAGE
20	This is full of bullshit
20	Will quickly be removed from lobby screen but the game mode selection button will keep the annoying warning/advert.
3	It's not Russian land either. Your argument is still complete nonsense.
23	There's doing stupid things when you're young. Then there's doing horribly stupid things when you're in your mid-30s and you're already active in Politics
4	Sure thing my dude. You keep on doing you. I wish you the best, good luck.
20	Grow up fool
3	We're sleep walking into, in the words of the Bank of England, a disordely Brexit. It's a bit problematic.
14	True enough. I'd love more LGBT friendly horror.
23	One of my cats always eats the other ones food. I never noticed it until he was obese. I'm not gonna make that mistake again.
10	It got completely banned I think, saw a post about it a while back in r/gore.
10	Seems like you care way too much
20	I'd smash
3	"Dentist did this to me I hate it. I knew i should have waited until ""it wad worse"" but i didn't. I regret it "
20	They don’t like him, so he is divisive. It’s projection.
23	Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. 
23	I’m surprised they arnt argonians
4	In that case you're very welcome to call your representative and tell them to agree to a bill which would reopen the government. Or tweet the president.
4	If they actually want to prevent abortions, they should be fighting for universal healthcare, comprehensive sex ed, and civilized parental leave policies.
20	You can't be serious.
10	You have encountered some very strange women my friend...
20	I don’t think his clothing was so tight when he purchased it..
4	Welcome to the club. You'll notice that I didn't say anything about degrees or certification, just the quality of your understanding.
20	I wish I could say the same, I feel like something important would happen and I wouldn’t know
9	It’s really hard to watch for some people because of how awkward and... just how stupid [NAME] is in this episode
0	Young [NAME] works to hard for his name to be slandered like this.
20	Pinkwashing a violent, repressive institution isn’t cool. 
25	Yeah probably should've chosen a better sub, but I couldn't think of one
3	anyone rooting for anybody but [NAME] is my enemy for (hopefully this long!) the next month
6	I thought I actually saw that happen in a clip
0	Thank you, lightwaves. Very cool.
2	How dare you disrespect my boy [NAME]
27	OMG this Extreme Love commercial. Yikes.

0	[NAME] !!!
17	I love rational comments.
3	Download it again.
20	For real tho let's dump our powerplay coach
0	I freakin love this channel
0	Are 3% of [NAME] really vegan?? That’s fantastic!
20	I feel like [NAME] would be upset about this too
3	Reddit culture is truly the worst.
20	No i didn’t all i know is that i binged 3 seasoms of it.
19	I used to have anxiety when calling people but I no longer have them at least just 20-30% anxiety.
1	Same thing I thought haha
20	Thought you were gonna go steak with ketchup in that last bit, ya pulled a sneaky
6	Why do I seem to hit 6/7, and can't go any deeper without throwing up. I wanna see and feel more shit FML lol.
12	Mate, just stop. You’re being an embarrassment.
4	Glad it had a positive impact on you. Welcome to the club!
15	I did not know that. Thanks!
0	By [NAME]! By [NAME]! It's the grand Champion!
14	Kind of wish they recorded a video of the shard of glass moving through the heart, we would all pee a little in our pants.
16	Sorry just seemed like you were trying to make it a [NAME] thing
6	Why would you do something so controversial and yet so brave?
6	Was there a new episode this week?
13	Super excited to watch them in Syracuse next year. Might actually spring for season tickets
14	That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take.
20	thats why I wear my mute button out.
20	makes for an ~~interesting rewatch~~ good drinking game
20	Don't have the light novels. Heard the translation was pretty bad on them but I discovered that Manga earlier today.
22	Exactly. My father is part of Homeland security and is furloughed. Homeland Security isn't completely shut down but they furloughed part of their work force.
4	If you want to live the dream, good luck! I won’t change my mind until I get my stolen ETH back from them 
20	ok
1	Ad hominem. Ridiculous argument, not even funny or hilarious.
9	[NAME], feel bad for that streamer, everyone has their moments on this game, it’s understandable
21	No one asked for that honesty.
6	Did he lose a bet or something? -edit- It took longer than it should have for me to realize that it was a mashup of different dudes...
9	I never read it, but I sure remember being creeped out by this claymation version
23	You mean anti-intelligent
3	I always get a kick out of the videos posted of cars and buses stuck around that area. Bathurst going up to St. Clair is also notorious.
0	Good for you OP! I hope you find a much better playgroup soon!
3	Go make it yourself then! : P
20	Great Scientists can keep you competitive even if you didn't get too much harassed in the early game.
3	Pretty blunt/rude on his part. Maybe he felt bad for you and wanted to be your friend though.
20	Them boys smelling even more blood in the water. Rack them fuckin points up boys!
11	I bloody hate L3-37's name. it's literally L337. How much stupider can a droid name get.
2	take my arrow. so fucking true
0	You're trying to come off smart, but failed. 
20	MUSK is just HITLER if you remember that: M=HI U=TL S=E K=R!
8	I care about me and my benefit.. No shits given about you (general you) . It's my job to vote my best interest
7	"Thanks and what even mean ""nobs""? "
17	Okay, I'll admit it. I laughed.
12	- me when I’m definitely not fine but too embarrassed to admit it
2	It's a self-identifying group, and they have killed quite a bit of people in their crusade for revenge. It's both absolutely pathetic and absolutely terrifying.
10	Exactly why I’m saying we won’t land KD ... but Knicks fans do know a lot about dreaming.
13	I can't tell you how happy I am that [NAME] and [NAME] are Polynesian Sauce guys.
20	Yeah, might just grab a coffee and be done with it.
20	Boy, she really does live rent free in your heads. At least conservative head rent is cheaper than D. C. rent. 
26	Turns out you can polish a turd. The trouble is, it's still just shit.
14	Everyone panics when they are on fire.
8	Please wake up
15	Wow nice way to live in an echo chamber.
8	Though i think i preferred it when it was artistic and gritty i still love that series. Listening to the audiobook he took the voices from. highly recomended
4	Oh he works as a medic in CA. So hes an Aemt in other states!
5	Careful, you are almost criticizing your god in chief. Your friends at TD will probably ban you for that.
20	Here comes the “Trade Nylander” crowd - people can’t see past the stat line.
18	I love your username
18	Love him as an Irish fan, but his range isn't far enough for NFL
20	Who would be deciding the quality standards? How would it work between genres or styles? Why would any of this even be enforced?
9	The real problem is the malicious prosecution engaged in by Monsanto against small farmers.
26	congrats. i'm broken rn but if I wasn't I'd be happy for you
20	That makes it an extra special accomplishment. Yay!
18	"I love that! We need a ""We have cookies"" line for her, now!"
20	Why don’t people just call the cops and give them the video?
13	I would pay good coin to read that love story.
9	Can't. Prequel bad. Bearded [NAME] Man idea bad. OT era only good thing.
17	No worries. Glad you like it
15	I recently got a job that I wanted so now I don't have to live paycheck to paycheck.
8	I hope all of y'all that are commenting isn't all men because not all women do that!
2	Good for you for shutting that door! You are not responsible for him. He’s a grown ass man who made his own mistakes.
20	Never mind the delays. Fish, unlike Wine or cheese doesn't improve with age.
20	I meant it's a sign to others that he is a crypto-Nazi. My bad, I wasn't clear.
20	Clock the flair but What are the judges on? I live for ms Manila but [NAME] safe again? Gurl..
20	Shoot first ask questions later
10	No, that's how you find the nurses who work at Vanderbilt Medical Center
20	You need professional help for that level of paranoia.
23	Voting for someone to tax you to death makes no sense
20	If being tired doesn’t work. Ask for a BJ
7	This is the same federal government that's been shut down for the last month?
1	NBA is like Westworld only completely opposite. Every time you act like your true self you get a T lol
18	Am love u
20	Yeah. Plus why he still living with his mom
4	I get that. That's why thet time limit. Even if it's just to reevaluate.
20	didnt he think to check out the back?
4	Agreed. Was just pointing out the rules to OP.
20	There’s at least a thousand hallways that look exactly like that with people that look exactly like that in America
20	SWOOOSH!!
20	"And when the humane society euthanizes perfectly healthy animals, are they also doing it so that ""people can no longer use them""?"
20	Yelling that to them seems correct. Did they respond?
3	I know. And it's very selfish of me to say, but I just wish it was different people that cared.
2	Have to agree. The government welfare and biased divorce courts which are enforced by the state are to blame.
4	Came here for the [NAME] reference, was not disappointed!
9	That's what I'm afraid of but I don't have a lot of free time so it would never work.
23	I mean, I acknowledged that I'm not going to become a GM lol, but could you elaborate?
4	I could have gone to a party, but it's 10 outside. Sue me.
20	Can't wait to bring it to 1
20	C'mon. Ship computer would *never* cheat on Geordi La Forge!
7	Well tell me what happened then
20	the trajectory of that is really weird! But [NAME], that guys arm, hand, possibly head is not liking the next .01 second!
20	Do not defend yourself.
9	That guy face was soul crushing
20	Well howdy neighbor. I'm also about 200m away from there. It inspired me to setup wireless security cameras.
0	This, great soundtrack to
1	"""joke's on you, I was only pretending"""
3	5. Puts you in debt 6. Isolates you from all social interaction 7. Leaves you with nothing but a product you can't sell
20	Also packed with preservatives and extra chemicals! Homemade Bread: 4 ingredients, Store Bread: ~22 ingredients...
21	And yet you have so much karma!
7	deleted ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.5933 ^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?
7	What? Trolls? Actually, yeah, probably. 
21	not giving a s* about what others say ;)
20	"Who knows, he could say ""rough"" and I could wind up in handcuffs."
4	I'd be ok with this former Israeli IDF general.
23	i didn't knew your toe can get that flat without breaking the nail in thousand of pieces
20	No homo dude nohomo I I I no homo man just no homo OMEGALUL we get it
20	He is [NAME]. That's the twist this soap opera needs!
2	How so? How do you keep stupid people from voting?
10	Never, ever, ever, ever double text. Pursue other girls after the first text is unanswered.
20	Define woman please if you're not going to use the accepted denotation.
9	It still baffles me how they cover for him, and his trace amounts, when they’re in his body because he cheated in the first place.
27	WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!?
26	There is no way around it :(
18	surprise surprise! cbs loves this phony old wannabee

1	honestly this made me smile like an idiot on the subway, thank you.
26	I think they're fine people but I don't want to date one again because it's just a pain re:eating.
27	Wow, i never really understood how bad the star wars perecuelse really are till this moment.
4	they both rugged, worn, and wrinkled, like fine leather !
20	[NAME]? We have a friend in one of those condos on 19th.
21	I suppose the circumstances of it would chance things a bit :p
20	by the time he hugs the last one another has been born
1	Oh dear. Ive tried to forget that. Lmao If some one brings this up, i just remind them we are also the toilet water town. Lol
15	Thank you for this. This sub isn’t a rating or selfie sub. There’s literally no poly content on this post.
15	Thanks man, words give me strength
1	Yup [NAME] is who me miss. Anyone notice though that his little southern twang ramped up to about 100x more when he went national?? Lol
11	It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
7	Or maybe you could just learn the match up since they already gutted him in the last patch.
20	Yaaaaaaas me too!!
20	This team is so untalented.
6	Hmmm to click or not to click... well goodbye SFW
17	There it is. I knew I wasn't the only one bothered by this.
20	Who do you think can lead the Packers to where they need to be?
1	i read your first sentence laughed and stopped reading easily verified basic historical facts are not conjecture genius
1	LOL. When she came back on after the first commercial break, there was loud beeping when she was talking. 
4	If people were downvoting due to the perceived insensitivity of it, then I guess I understand. 
27	You mean Ichigo/Nero/Black Ranger/I'm a Frog. Did not know that [NAME] voiced [NAME], but it does exsplain why he sounded so familiar.
20	“We just need more MONEY!”
6	What deal did [NAME] make to the **benefit** of the Syrian [NAME]??
4	Thank You, that does seem to be the consensus. 
2	Screw DBs swill, their creepy Children of God (cult) employees, and the traffic mess it creates on Rural in Tempe
0	Ah I set myself up for that one. Alright you win it does look cool.
5	Poor [NAME]. Give him some Enfamil. He will feel better soon.
13	Those fries look delicious!!!
0	Pretty sure he's by far and away the biggest asshat on this sub lmao
8	It says new, but I feel like they should call it 'used.'
18	Damn, I’d love to own a stg-44...
7	I’m kind of out of the loop... is THIS the big Chungus?
20	Now that’s wild
14	Being so gullible is the frightening part. durr da durr he downvote me
20	I don’t watch the Colts, but out of interest do they insist on making [NAME] block consistently like we did.
20	That’s what they get for being greedy 🙃
20	Which is why people sell on TPT...
18	I liked the charlie one more.
20	That's because real anarchism is anti-capitalist, shove a knife up your urethra nerd.
20	I guess they never miss huh
17	I'll chase you till the ends of the eaaaaarth, Shooooooooooooooooooooooooooocker!!!!!!!
8	I wish I could forget about the redesign. Sadly reddit is adamant about reminding me all the time it exists.
9	I thought it was going to cut to them still trying to get it out of its mouth! When the kid was holding it again I lost it
4	Something like Chariot will occur again but all electric and highly autonomous. Something I wish [NAME] could do right now.
20	Step 1. Choose a new team (avoid Carlton and GC) Step 2. Enjoy!
15	Seeing something as beautiful as this just made my day today! Thanks for sharing :)
2	To bad your mother didn’t swallow your dumbass
23	I just forgot that arguing with people on the internet is useless and like talking to a wall. So Im out.
4	Go to highschool with the guys I went with. You'll get the hang of it in no time..
5	Oh sorry. To clarify, I was wondering if I should mention that I am more than willing to help her if need be.
20	They said that about Standard Oil as well. No company is too big to fail provided the state is stirred enough to take serious action.
20	This goes back like a decade though. He just has the palette of a 4 year old.
5	A joke is subjective pal, second of all you need to mature/grow up and get a taste of the real world before giving your political opinions.
15	I’ll try to follow your advice. Thank you very much for your kind answer and your prayer. I’ll pray for you too.
20	You forgot warden's spamming shoulder bash
20	Yep, that's my daily commute.
17	glad you made the trip from a fellow austinite
20	I'm sure it was Leyou, the Chinese chicken farm company, that had shares, and not Tencent.
20	7) All success, disappointment, and venting posts may only be made as comments in the weekly megathread.
20	Oh for fuck’s sake.
20	Am yisrael chai is a phrase we should never take for granted.
10	Sweet [NAME] I'd be psyched to get [NAME]. I do *not* believe that will happen though.
10	No offense but you have no idea what you’re talking about. Maybe you like neurotic, needy men, but the general populace does not.
20	The only way this is OK is if their kid made it for them. But then you feel bad for the kid. Lose lose..
20	Meh, whenever I travel with someone who can't walk fast, I just wait for the next train.
1	okay for real, i saw this when the game ended. i died. i fucking died laughing. -sent from my HeavenPhone (TM)
18	I love conspiracy theories with no shred of proof
20	"I've met very few ""bad"" people in my life. Most people I arrest are ok people who made unfortunate mistakes."
20	[NAME] is so cute! And [NAME] is a very dashing name.
20	This guy fucking gets it.
13	It makes us more determined to tank for Zion
3	What bothers me more is the picture quality of the donut compared to the steak
17	This was literally me!
10	It's not *literally* the same investigation.
0	That's sad. I'm 16 and where I am there are loads of athiests my age. It's great.
4	You're right, I was just trying to avoid getting too specific, as all financial advise will vary based on OP's financial situation and needs.
13	This is a 10/10 on concept alone. I can't wait to see if it's any good.
26	I just wanted my knees to stop hurting
20	Relevant:
4	If you want any hope of getting better, you must stop everything and anything with underage girls...forever 
8	And I’m just sitting here wishing my cat would come at least sit by me.
1	>No but I know that fat ass just says [NAME] man bad lol [NAME] is pretty fat. Good observation.
3	I constantly feel like I'm my husband's best friend and it's just a matter of time until we break up :(
18	Yep, they expect you to revolve around them, but think they’re exempt from returning the favour. 
20	>uploaded sept 20, 2016 >frysuspiciouseyes.jpg
17	If you feel like venting, I am happy to listen.
17	NL West had 3 teams in the playoffs in 2017 and 2 in 2018......wtf you on about
0	No, that looks h*ckin delicious 
26	It’s very difficult for men to have platonic friendships with women. Unfortunately it’s just part of life.
1	What a political whore Uncle [NAME] is!
23	It's common knowledge that offering to feed yourselves to wolves makes them leave you alone out of boredom.
4	I believe that this may be meant for the person above me, for I have moved into the realm of monetized bananas. 
20	Hah! You’re the best NERD!
20	Edibles!!
26	Boomers ruined the world
27	Nah dude it shows they aren't depressed adults but instead very cool kiddos.
3	That's where your mind went? Most of us instantly think about Winnie the Pooh and the Hundred Acre Woods, man. What's wrong with you?
4	Love how science doesn’t matter for human biology. What about climate change?
13	Get jiggy with it.
7	Maybe he has really bad short term memory, and is genuinely curious how the cop got his attention.
20	I think there are more deleted comments than actual comments.
6	You serious?
20	Do you work in education?
0	Long hair for guys should happen more, it looks cool *and feels nice too*

1	Lol my ex loved [NAME] binged trough all seasons.

1	The local council is gonna have fun removing all those dodgy fillings.
4	That one is much better.. you win :(
18	Love your username
1	Beans, yo! I used to hate them but now I sometimes just eat a can of beans for a meal. They are hella filling too.
20	Man I wish that was a real sub
20	No I meant it's like the 5th post I've seen this week about it. 3 of them have been memes.
0	Nah, girl, you did great. I'm also shocked by guys who want to hook up without a condom.
2	That’s not very cash money of you
2	Understandable. Retail sucks and people are nut
4	I used to think that too, before I got over Trump Derangement Syndrome and took the red pill.
4	[NAME] is da man. A gangsta mathematician who had the guts to seduce the most beautiful Spartan woman of her time.
7	Im sorry, my autocorret happened. But i think you can read between the lines? Or maybe just go full r*** :)
1	Yeah you are second. Time to move on lol
21	I hope you two can figure this out. I feel for you and for him.
3	Was already mad when it wasn’t center. Then when it got knock over, i was furious. Damn machine has no brains.
15	Thanks man, my brother and my girlfriend just told me to laugh it off; but the thought doesn't stop haunting me. 
20	[NAME] is the granddaddy of ROM sites. Check it out while you can, boys and girls.
10	You also can’t prove it happened so logically this doesn’t exist and is a paradox that never happened therefore pi = 3.14159
9	Until they find out oh she went underground 🙄
2	u fucked up
20	I brought it back up they are with amway and LTD
20	Is that not implied by continuing to be friends and work with her?
1	Lol just leave it bruh it adds character
10	Something would go terribly wrong for [NAME] causing him to have to leave. It’s how his ability works.
2	Really? Cuz hella 18 year olds with bad grades from my high school seemed to do it with ease.
20	I just mean she keeps saying never again. Again.
13	Hey same here!! The first week of April!
20	Lol! Nope. Any muscle in your body will shrink if yiu dont use it.
6	he's clearly not equipped to argue, i can't decide if he's a dumbass teenager or a dumbass boomer. 
7	And those are countries ruled according to [RELIGION] principles?
18	oh man [NAME] is the guy that said the show saved his life, love ya buddy
20	">player consistently plays like shit ""Durr hurr here come da hate train"""
11	These are worse than the [NAME] ones [NAME]
9	No. No it isn't. Its a bad sitcom joke.
20	If [NAME] gets the better of [NAME] today, EV should learn not to start [NAME] at RB against pacy attackers m 
23	I mean if it was crowded or rush hour I understand, but I don't see that much an issue if its empty like this..
20	[NAME] didn't have the n-word pass
20	Man this family looks like they’re straight outta hope country from far cry 5
27	I wonder why don't we share this planet together as human beings instead of slaving and being like robots... [NAME]
10	I can’t imagine choosing McD’s over Banh Mi, that’s just a complete lack of respect for your taste buds.
3	They absolutely dont know what love is.
1	"if it's ""unavailable"" it's deffo not from the cold lol :D"
20	Being adorable mostly
26	Dude. Same. That would just be... Devastating.
15	Thanks will check them out!
3	I woke up drunk and mouthy
20	Ok so now you know what this dude is about. Give him no more chances and move on past him asap.
8	oh i wish i didn't read that, [NAME]
27	We don't know anything yet till it happens. It's great to see everything think they know the eliminations order.....lol. you will be shooked
20	There's ignite on the lane too, that's an upkeep kill on censor. I agree that horn into coup could have been a better play though.
2	As someone who has polluted their body with copious amounts of sugar, I somewhat doubt steroids are any worse. Abuse anything and it will hurt you.
20	Holy crap. I need to listen to that speech in full on my commute home then.
6	> [NAME] is a religion, not a race. In the Holocaust, did the NAZI's commit genocide against a religion? or a race of people? 
3	"This is the sort of chucklefuck who finds himself saying ""and there was nothing I could do"" after a mishap... often."
20	This hit me a little too close to home
4	I love Nigeria, visited a couple of times. Lived in Angola for two years
15	My most sincere condolences.
10	There's literally nothing wrong with it except you being worried about the purity of your partner like c'mon.
3	Another nipple man, we should form our own Subreddit
20	[NAME] does not deserve to be with [NAME] just to be cleared. She forced herself and kissed him to prevent him from going to Zero Two.
20	Is there a customer service number? If so, what is it?
6	Was at the game yesterday and at the game now. It's a miserable gong show. Why do I keep doing this to myself?
4	Good to know! *Makes note to Grand Revenge Scheme draft 2.doc to only slash three of the ex's tires*
27	What the fuck did I just read?
20	Send your cutest delivery boi!
5	Caring too much
10	I unironically agree with everything on the left side of this.
20	I think she looked perfect beforehand. They're just too big!
23	On reflection I might've been harsh on [NAME], but Bandai's existence was forgettable like a swing flashback in Naruto.
20	favorite athlete of all time for sure. [NAME] and [NAME] are my other 2 haha. [NAME] up there for my own sanity
27	Exactly. How that woman has survived two no confidence votes amazes me.
24	If you look back it is odd that most violent murderers have all eaten taco bell at some point.
6	I’m still not sure how we managed to do that. Gas prices in this state has gone up around 70 cents per gallon since around 2013
20	Nothing new is happening. Society never gave a fck about broken men. So it's only natural.
20	Hire the best prostitute you can afford dude
20	He seems to think that will take too long. I guess he’d rather complain to me.
25	Can't tell how cold it is if the battery is completely dead. RollSafeMeme.jpeg
10	Nah it's not that, [NAME] is just boring and sad
9	I live in Suiderstrand, which is past Aghulas, no option for fibre here unfortunately :(
0	I thought [NAME] the apostle was *fantastic.* Seeing those early [NAME] suffering like that really drove home what a baby I am.
27	Oh, wow, I didn't know my Dad had a Reddit account.
3	How about dumb trolls like you who only repeat your own stupid narratives and word-bending 24 hours a day
20	Because it's stealing from her company.
15	This. Thank you.
26	This wouldn’t feel so bad if sales and footfall weren’t but many external pressures were keeping profits down.
19	I hope he isn't scared to over power the thibs guys on the coaching staff. It seems like he is a hestitant to make any major changes.
7	A part of me rejects this as being real. No person can be this delusional right???
6	It is being talked about all the time on this site. What are you on about?
14	"I'm more worried about him scamming children than ""oNLY"" scamming them into thinking they'll get $100."
17	Wow, the interview with her mom really made that clip.
17	Oh you're the life of the party.
5	“Respect the house” while it is impossible to live in your own before you're 30 nowadays
27	That sounds intelligent. Wonder why you don’t have a job you have to interview for.

3	new genders about to drop doesn’t strike me as a bad joke tbh.
7	[NAME] and a libertarian? Is that some post-modern BS like a person can be a man and a woman at the same time?
20	Yup. I don't want to soil the paper unless I have something very interesting to write about.
14	Something extremely fishy is going on here with this story.

14	I'm REALLY glad the guy saved him but seeing him so pitiful and scared really lingers with me. :(

15	[NAME] is one of my favorite non dodger players, he’d make a great addition to the dodgers, hope they push for him

5	Stay strong brother - it's coming.
18	I like that that guy didn't make a snarky remark in 2015 because he was upset that another MP was sitting in his usual seat.
5	Definitely valid in my case. But let's remember our friends who have had or are currently having a rough time when it comes to family life, as well.
17	Wow, so he was pulling his own little mini [NAME] scam. Explains why he couldn't use your reporting tool.

11	Uhhhh, existed... Ever been to Arkansas? It’s boring as fuck.
2	lol why would we leave the PL’s top scorer on the bench

2	Stop the algorithm 😂😂 Like she’s living in the matrix or something!
3	Oh....yuck
0	Gets right back on his phone call. I like it. Must’ve been one important booty call.

5	Nia even in its current state vr can help you with that. And maybe even more 5 years from now.

11	Translation: you should see her vagina! She can't fight you off! The double entendre is more than a bit unsavory.
20	Which doesn't fit with the fact that they built massive bathrooms during the construction of Hogwarts.
0	Her hair is beautiful! I have high hopes for her staying clean and on the right path.

20	Also N.e.r.d and [NAME] reference lmao
3	Hey now, don’t try to have the guy killed. This is an upstanding sub.

0	Via Napoli in Epcot is amazing, but no garlic bread (the pizza is great though).

3	You’re ignorance would be excusable if you weren’t so douchey about it.

4	correct. i am the one who decides if something is funny to me or not.
4	Nevermind, I see now Yikers 
17	This is amazing!
4	talking about [NAME] i think
20	So, he was partly an average product of his time, and partly a terrible, notorious man by the standards of his time.
20	They basically worship this.
27	Of all the people in the world, I honestly can't believe that Reddit hates [NAME].
9	I first liked [NAME], but disliked her after [NAME].

10	I keep swallowing chunks of infection from my sinuses that are draining. It’s really ruining the wine.

7	Oh that’s actually seriously a relief, how do you know that though?
0	True, haha. Anywho, have a great day.
5	She's one among 435 members of the House. You're giving her an awful lot more authority than she actually has.
0	Brilliant post!
20	This is a bit of a political post but I just felt like venting.

3	Exactly! It amazes me how many people dont communicate with each other. Talk about it, see what they say. Discuss. Come to a conclusion.
1	And I will laugh at everyone wasting their first round pick on him.

7	I said stop though. What’s with right wingers and not understanding consent?

10	I don't believe you, but even if that were true it still harms nobody
27	This. I saw a life pro tip a couple weeks ago about this. I cant believe how clean my kitchen has gotten.
20	Maybe this person only likes musicians with the letter B. Let’s see if they like Busdriver. Also, chanting for “[NAME]” is the best.

7	Ha. Do you have evidence of his cheating? Send it to his family and don’t say another word.

17	You must be fun at parties.
20	I'd love to see something following her younger days. Also something STRQ related would be awesome.

20	And people still support him....
20	I just mean she keeps saying never again. Again.

13	This. We already have so much more OL talent. We need another WR and TE, but I'm kinda excited
4	I would agree, but at the same time if it pisses off [NAME] supporters enough to keep them home in 2020, I'm all for it.
9	I see, Unfortunately I don't think equity has ever turned out well in history. Humans have tried many times and failed with catastrophic consequences.
20	Go to your room.
24	Yes, thankfully it has never happened to me, asking out of (morbid) curiosity.
16	Actually feel sorry for her. She has depression and low self esteem, this is not going to make it better.
20	What? They all look entirely different. Yes, they are all handsome, masculine men, but that's it.
9	Oh no! More non-existent performance issues to complain about!! Can't wait to be playing it while all these self-righteous gamers take their noble stands...
18	"But ""[NAME] knows the heart! The baby will be in heaven."" Yeah....."

6	[NAME] and a libertarian? Is that some post-modern BS like a person can be a man and a woman at the same time?
11	Except [NAME], he somehow defies any common sense and sometimes he comments here.
19	Me when I spent 90% of the art exam time finishing the head and need to rush the rest of the body.
20	> I miss frequent, monogamous sex enough that I miss a relationship very much. This is really the core of why I want a relationship.
20	But if I’m not mistaken [NAME] said in his draft interviews that he can speak something like 5 different languages. So one of them could be Italian
21	The kind look on his face certainly helps

1	You’re a joke
2	The 100,000 who died in the Tokyo bombing during WWII weren't killed by [NAME], it was just the passive spreading of fire. Fuck off, genocide apologist.

24	Hijab, keeps my ears warm
10	If they didn't want the wheels to be stolen, they shouldn't have made then so easily stealable!

9	as a kpop stan and a army, i am very disappointed
0	I'm not surprised someone asked that. Good [NAME], people are stupid.

1	I would never do such a thing. :P
20	It's tasty. Had one on bone marrow once. I've had weirder things before
20	Doesn't change the fact that the Lions weren't in a position to get him because they had too much money tied up in their QB.
7	Is that you [NAME]?
4	They are having a whole bunch of problems , maybe they are paying so the state doesn't go after them as well.
20	To be fair, [NAME] broke his heart first
20	Enjoy your gold!
0	I was entertained into the 4th. My sons played well. We lost. I'll take it.

8	I wish they would put dfs in for [NAME] right now
4	oh right that was a huge leap my bad
23	It's so odd. He even sits in the co-pilot spot. Why isn't he now the pilot? [NAME] had never even flown into space before.
20	He had plenty of opportunities to play with Stamkos in TB and he never turned into a star.
15	Will add to Plano's directory when I make it. Thanks!

0	Because it was a cool video it was sweet, and because it was a fash it was bitter. Simple as that.
26	I am [NAME] total lack of suprise

15	Thank you for fading
6	This is terrifying. Good luck to you and your family. Hopefully they figure out who the creepers are very soon.
20	It looks like Livonia flipped light blue as well? That’s pretty impressive.
20	It seems like the problem predates the current administration, which makes me think it has more institutional roots.
7	Which will happen.
6	Um... I’m extremely concerned as to which one’s business and which one’s casual.
20	Depends. My first name for coworkers, middle for friends.

7	So where are all these [NAME] lining up to be landscapers and farmhands for minimum wage?
10	They won’t. They’re just going to ignore it because fortnite makes them money.
13	I’m pretty sure you can run as long as one of your parents is a US citizen (correct me if I’m wrong).
25	Sorry, should have searched for the artist's name. Karma Decay is a lot less reliable than I thought it was.
3	using the crying emoji is a sin against humanity, and you should be executed via the electric chair for doing so. 
23	Kinda is. But whatever. Complaining on reddit works too. Except it doesn’t.
10	This can’t be considered cruelty free because now someone’s hair style is gonna suffer
20	[NAME] after he declares he loves playing Fortnite, wants to play with his brother no matter what and loves Vancouver.

3	You're saying [NAME] sucks at drafting...?
3	If you bake em you're gonna have a bad time
0	Nirvana is a great band but a good chunk of people in their fan base are just awful (underratedly awful)
20	That treatise is working well for the environment! 😉
2	Why is it impossible? Can we not manage our own education and incentivise people into the fields we need them?
19	Nothing says “I peaked too soon” more than a class ring.

5	He claimed surv cuz he didn't want to be shot by the vig
14	[NAME] shitting the bed like a 4 year old with diarrhea

11	[NAME] yer fucked.
4	Oh god, going to a social event with someone and never leaving their side is me at almost every social event I go to.

20	Bah! You should get it the old fashioned way! By shitposting.
5	[NAME] was dork anyway. Be happy he ain't our hero.
5	I think you need a better partner. Continuing to go after you said you want to stop is kind of abusive.
20	Video...must get video when popping in the pubic region. Now go to your room.
7	Everything is cool when no one gets hurt.. But as soon as something bad happens, we all scream idiots... Why...?

20	it's quite a large red flag. It depends on the context, but if they are in her dating league, I would be suspicious. 
20	I thought it was a bachelorette party. Re-reading it appears it isn't, which makes her reaction even more immature.
20	RDX. Definitely a head turner
20	Saturn comes back around, SHOWS YOU EVERYTHING

20	The street drugs here are laced with fentanyl, i think I’ll do something else
20	That may work in General, but I think there’d still be problems. 
23	I didn’t even notice that one. I noticed the bottom right one
10	Not at all. I wasn't offended in the least. Thanks for the promotion!
4	The co-worker thing is generally for the best,the rest I agree.
21	I wish the theme was still larger than life but their outfit prompt was fetish/bdsm wear and that they all posed next to giant sex toys
19	Well what's that old saying, those who can do, do. Those who can't teach. 
20	That’s an insult to special needs people everywhere.
4	If all else was equal it’d be a good idea but I don’t think it’s feasible.
27	I don't think you can find a better support line in contenders than alarm and elk. absolutely insane and clutch it's unbelievable
2	Time to cut him off. Or find a way to get him good help. Cause he sounds a little dangerous.
4	Thanks. I needed this reminder today.
4	this would work!!
27	I mean I like the park and I was surprised by that poll too

20	Appreciate the love! Maybe during the offseason, for sure! I'll pass it along
15	The most sense the internet has produced in a long time. [NAME] bless this dude.

20	"You mean ""first name"" ""middle name"" was not clear enough?"
6	Weird I can relate to this but in the same time I can't relate to this
4	No one ever laid on their death bed and said, “I regret not working even harder.”
10	Didn’t locals cry bloody murder about that and get it rejected? I hope the state tell them to pound sand and do it anyway.

4	Look [NAME], those curly q's on your face make me so hot I can't think straight.
10	I don't really know how to explain because English is not my first language, I'm sorry.

15	Loved every part of this series so far!! Keep up the good work!
27	Wait... today isn't April 1st...
8	Yeah, not gonna happen. People need these things in their life to feel better about themselves.
20	I didn't realise there was only one car on the road?
0	The forgotten [NAME]? He's pretty good on the Flash as [NAME].
20	So even confronted with overwhelming evidence, you doubled down? My man 
1	It was santa he had a REALLY big sack this year. :)

20	That sub lost it's way a long time ago
0	That’s been arguably his strongest attribute this season?
20	would whip out meat scepter, but unironically
20	Wish my life was this easy :’) Lets just hope she didn’t kill you
20	Grace and frankie
20	You guys can’t stay married. Attraction is the most important thing if you guys actually think about attraction at all.
8	I should have said without nuts in hindsight, but this woman was ready to kill. Gotta love hospitality sometimes.
27	I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that.
7	Any other reasonably priced recommendation?
20	I love that when [NAME] was actually further left of HRC on a few issues like TPP.
10	I don’t think that tells us any moralising lesson on the practice of incest.
20	I drew that Godzilla!!! I'm OPs friend btw.
26	Holy bait-and-switch, [NAME]. I’m so sorry, that has to be incredibly stressful to have to be around and deal with.

20	>cold, dead butt Ah, so it's laughter. Laughter is what kills me. 
5	same here OP, reading some of these stories makes me want to hug my DM for being a decent human being as well as a solid DM
20	Mine is 2.5 and trying to drop her last nap. She needs it so desperately though. It is HELLLLLL dealing with this.
20	Now, could you please turn the card around and show me those wacky three numbers on the back. 
2	[NAME], that uniform. At least the Nazi [NAME] had decent fashion sense. This is a crime against fashion
14	Absolutely! The Republicans are craven
3	dude people here can be assholes. there’s nothing wrong with taking a break.
23	Generally, but Chicago has easily gotten 12 inches of lake effect snow in the past.
20	I guess the top left forgot to read the part of history where their ideology failed many times, and killed many people
18	Wha? I'd love more background on this.
20	Yes. Especially if I go to sneeze and I lose it, I just look up to a light and bam. Sneeze time!
0	[NAME] is an **integrity** man. Without it, there is nothing. edit 1:without it, not with it, sorry typo
1	Do you really think anyone would support this legislation on any side. Jeez man lay off the [NAME] plus that would really destroy the CIA/FBIs blackmail program lol
18	I love this reply.
4	I'm a girl and got the belt for doing something similar with another girl.
7	"[NAME], what is the ""short run"" vs the ""long run""?"
18	We love him, duh. He's our NT captain and our ace.
0	You're so talented OP. I like your sense of humor. But it hurts too cuz too real :(
7	Paying respects?
10	Omg stop spamming.
20	Is he really your buddy if you have to ask us how to talk to him?
0	This is a good map though.... Just needs some minor QOL tweaks.
15	Thanks for posting OP, much love to the [NAME] out there.
6	Is it actually happening?
4	That’s good
21	Just turned on the game. I hope I brought the boys some good luck

7	Why did you repost this 7 hours after your initial post!? And to the same sub!? Yo, that's not cool man.
4	hi [NAME], toxicity in a multiplayer game is something that should always be expected no matter the game cause people are assholes.
20	Well, no- the person serving you already provided ID to get the job, so they’ve already confirmed their age
0	Congratulations and by the way, you’re not fat, you are down to earth.
12	no wonder i never noticed because i skip the pilot everytime i restart the series

1	thanks! yours inspired my to post mine lol
10	Banning abortion causes way more harm than good and is evil to be against. Same with requiring suffering people to suffer. you seem evil
6	Leave [NAME] or [NAME], only one of em.. replace one with maybe [NAME]
21	Oh, they're as real to me as [NAME] to me man. I don't leave he house without throwin some chick bones first.
23	The NBA fan was just one year younger last year and probably had the same viewing habits, thus not impacting the results of the year over year comparison. 
27	I wonder if we need to find a way, as a people, to not be so dependent on the government. 
3	You look like a bear.... An ugly cartoon bear
15	no, thanks for asking 
0	He looks cute, but if you have drugs in your underwear, he will attac. 
14	Well, glad I could help. Have a fantastic day and don’t let the straights scare you away!
20	Sounds like a standard room and board agreement. Nothing communist about that at all.
0	Fake news! but really, that's awesome to have a parent that actually understands how to teach their child accountability. 
18	[NAME] looks queasy already I like where this is going
15	Thanks! I love watching him every week
23	> But, President [NAME] can just hand out pardons for anything federal. Presidential pardons don't affect impeachments.
25	I am sorry for making fun of your username, I sincerely apologize.
1	Lol ik it's just I wanted people to figure it out and not the bot to ruin it.
13	Oh no! That’s my favorite! Nothing like losing an organ to get you to eat healthier.
23	Considering you are also a child, I can't say I'm surprised by your edgy hot take.
20	A lot of LGBT people I know just love D&D. Especially since character creation is just everything they want about self-expression and then some.
20	Mr. [NAME] Moderate himself. I do hope the DCCC pours money into [NAME] rematch campaign when he declares.
6	Why would you doubt it dumbass?
24	Dude was okay?! Oh thank god, i figured at best paralyzed from the waist down
0	West Hartford, CT. Unfortunately it's not religious. Thank you for the response.
1	that sounds fun!
26	That poor kid. That is going to cause some issues for them as well down the road.
26	Tried to ride the Overwatch train and crashed miserably.
3	Her dad must be a gorilla who’s in to bondage.
6	Maybe they mean like older kid free? I'd contact the coordinator and ask them if your baby is okay.
5	Well thats survival sweety. Run away live to fight another day. You on the other hand are the one that learns the hard way and ends up dying first!
7	If we're bullies, what does that make police who actually arrest people for rape and pedophilia? The final boss?
12	I really only do this after a while if awkward silence, which may make it even more awkward tbh
4	Yep. I'm glad I never did. I'll gladly use their service for free when it suits me and give them nothing in return
0	Hell yeah bois
0	"Even [NAME] has said ""I'm happy *for you*"" to pregnant women he's known."
3	Or plan ahead, call 511 periodically for updates, and don't put your shitty load ahead of your own life.
27	You're the reason Publix was out of meatballs today. Hmph!
27	I cannot believe how unbelievably well [NAME] is playing. It’s insane he hasn’t scored.
20	"Just sit her down and say ""are you okay? You seem to be having a hard time lately."" See what she says. Communicate. "
20	Just watch anime,play games,watch movies or sleep. If you feel extra energetic then work out a bit. At least this is how I spend my time
15	Ah thanks. I was posting on mobile so sub rules aren’t as obvious.
20	>!the only time it's become a harem is in the epilogue, and it's only 1 part of him!<
0	That's gorgeous!
0	And just the “stop looking at me” was so old school. It was nice!
20	By that definition, though, everyone with any relationships outside their mono romantic partner is polyamorous, and I don't think that makes sense to say. 
15	Thank you! I call on Monday to find out when I have court
20	Visit Texas, or come to AZ. Then you’ll understand.
20	Shotgun! But do I get to play with all the buttons too?
18	Is this a [NAME] reference. I feel like it is.
4	That is true, yet that is a problem of the systematic exploitation in capitalism, not the fault of existence/birth per se. 
4	GOATs is what killed overwatch for me, this patch is probably gonna bring me back. 
0	This is too cute :)
9	There’s a lot of us ladies here, unfortunately 😔
20	they were very hot for me half way in the year now diamonds seem dead opened 200 packs last week got 1 diamond
20	Since they only do 6 a year now I would rather it be somone more exciting and surprising
13	The person next to you has a high chance of having candy or something cool packed in there so it would be nice to have variety
26	Stop with this revisionist history we literally just let him go because HE SUCKED
20	She was eating gates BBQ at one point. KANSAS CITY PRIDE
4	Welp , that statement is not very wrong.
27	I can’t believe only 3 people pet the cat. Not even the cameraman pet the cat!
7	Tf what it this for a motivational speech?? Tf is fb doing to these kids
8	I guess Metric is old enough now for one of their songs to be Grey’s title. Huh.
18	No, no. I love the ones where patients succeed. It’s not that. It just seemed like everyone phoned it in this time. 
4	Yeah different people get it totally different. I don't get it at all fortunately
12	The school should make a list of sexual assaulters. The boys who engage in this should be shamed publicly.
21	I'll keep u updated man. It's only a 7eth withdrawal so hopefully it processes quickly.
4	Leave it to a maintenance technician to not do it right the first time.
20	*Sweats in robot
17	Convinced me...now let's trade [NAME] for [NAME] and get back to the SuperBowl
15	THIS. Thank you for this.
3	Hey, I'm not saying it's autotune. I'm just fucking around. That long sample gave me a good opportunity to improvise.
20	LOL watch this with the Raptors' commentary:
0	Genius. I'm so doing this
4	I completely agree with mondawggg. Playing the petty way instead of discussing the issue with him directly is so much more productive....wait
18	Oh my. Bless this dog. He is a big boy. I love him so much. Tell him I love him.
20	This is an old carnie trick. There are sites that have debunked this guy.
14	LOL, once in a lifetime. Sheesh, this sub is obsessed
3	“Why is there always someone that brings eggs and tomatoes to a speech?” -[NAME]
15	Thank [NAME].
6	Why do you keep failing? Is there a particular part you can practice on, or just nerves?
20	I remember seeing her twitter profile when it all went down and she was a rocket
20	It was 3 grams in total, my buddies and I rolled with our own stuff
5	The only advice I'll give is to not come back here when you find out that she's cheating on you.
0	Classic Leslie!
6	When will this finish
21	Guess it's a good thing he cant feel them anymore
15	Love this! Love you! Thanks for sharing!
3	If you all keep nagging me with this question I will turn this car around and then *no one’s* getting to watch the trailer.
9	I didn't know of [NAME] before I saw that episode. I fucking love that man and have watched an unhealthy amount of him since.
20	I’ve been saying this since the beginning, it would help so much in a intense gunfight
4	You're giving the coyotes faaaaarrrr to much credit they cross mostly around the wall.
20	[NAME] isn't likely to get traded. Out of the 4 he's the least likely.
0	You’re an amazingly helpful man. All the rumours about you are false.
7	For extra measure tape it right by your crotch so she can't take it for sexual assault reasons
15	Thank you for your message, I read it when I woke up and it helped. Thank you for showing kindness to a stranger
1	Naw man Asain men have an easier time. Most of my asain friend are pretty boy. Fuckbois lol
5	It is so good to hear from you. Stay safe!
14	My god the tension on the button... I can only imagine.😥
17	Now the 'fun' really starts. :(
20	No one cares
9	That sounds terrible! I get hay fever some years, I also have eczema and anxiety, all at once sounds like pure hell.
20	Damn....poor guy
10	I'm also a human being but I can't think of any reason why I would physically hurt a woman.
20	Try to be rational instead of angry.
4	Ah ok, nice one. Thanks.
3	2016 was also the worst year of my life
6	"I think I translates more into ""Waiting to see what kind of Brexit turd-burger Westminster eventually vomits up""."
4	Was stabbed by a pencil when I was younger, can confirm gave me all the knowledge of the universe.
6	If you don't know how/where to find a source for that you clearly aren't very well read on the subject.
26	Sadly not. [NAME] confirmed they couldn't make female premier skins for male characters and vice versa, because their hurt/hit boxes are different from one another.
4	I agree with you, but you know, sharia *is* sharia, which I find a tad more frightening 
2	Disgusting. Truly disgusting.
20	Let’s gooooo WHI
8	Not saying I know whats on his mind but he did say all he cares about is winning tbh only time will tell
5	You can do it girl! I believe in you! :)
2	It regenerates hate. It's hate motivational.
15	Thanks for the review, comments, etcetera.
11	I would like to say that I see plenty of people in their young adult life that are still incapable of living on their own.. lol
1	Exactly, but I guess I've gotten used to people forgetting the club exists haha
1	but this girl said no make out lmao she just want a cuddle buddy till marriage XD
18	I love that idea!! And the homework is almost always work that wasnt finished in class. None of her teachers assign homework unless its a project.
4	Welcome to the subreddit!
3	What are you talking about? Anything bad that happened was [NAME] fault - only good things were [NAME] doing!
9	I know I am very worried
9	"That's a funny way of spelling ""Don't make me feel bad about my bad choices"""
1	Lol. Thanks for the advice friend
3	No homo dude nohomo I I I no homo man just no homo OMEGALUL we get it
0	That’s great of you :)
15	> take already pretty average ingredients and add more stuff that actually makes the sandwich worse like Primanti's. Hahaha this is a great way to describe Primantis.
20	This is clearly the world's most dangerous gang
9	Well I mean this game is so stupid in a lot of ways tbh
20	Oncologist: I have some thoughts on this Centrist: No one wants to hear about it. Pander to someone else
20	Oh so that’s what you are into huh?
1	In an unfunny situation you made me laugh, so thanks 😅
20	> social media addiction is real Except, for her, it's not addiction, just a means to scam the morons who believe her lies.

15	Thanks my boet
20	wanting to kill other people doesn't? all i'm saying is, you wanna kill people - start with yourself. 
13	Happy looking fella ain’t he!
15	Hard Candy. You're welcome.
20	I did this first try but then the next time I played I was ducking hollering
4	Agreed. To add, we also need to see how coaching changes shake out when it's all done.
20	So as the Iron Islands and that doesn't make them more commited.
21	Not really the same, but we're the most vulnerable type to be on the spectrum. That explains why autists often appear as savants.
20	You are going to do the dishes now
3	It's racism. It doesn't make me angry, it makes me feel sorry for their ignorance and yours.
2	Wtf is that
20	The hardest part is trying to figure out what anyone is talking about with all these F degrees.
1	I remember all the Bolt-on jokes this sub was making when it happened. All the best [NAME]
0	[NAME] is so daddy
20	Winter isn't even that bad here.
20	[NAME] was mad, I could see it in his eyes 
20	>They will sell us the ropes and all that. Quoting a mass murderer who especially targeted democratic socialists on the subject of preparing mass murder...
20	Hey, [NAME]. You still with the mafia?
18	I love that username
7	So I suppose they’re more like the flying monkeys than the wicked witch?
14	I’m feeling the same about the nets and hornets. I’m only worried the hornets can’t cover
7	Genetic science is changing the jewelry game?
26	I tip my invisible hat anytime I drive past this dealership. What an unfortunate surname.
9	Did feel that one but I find it hard to tell sometimes
15	I’ve never been in love, haha. So I wouldn’t know.. thank you for this comment :)
20	It is the internet. It's the place these guys call home.
11	Her comments are disgusting. Reminds me of my mother. I'm so sorry.
18	Oh my [NAME] give her as much food as she wants!
4	Just like an unwritten rule to discuss a perfect game during a perfect game. Interesting
0	What a legend.
2	Where the f are you going to school that you are hearing such remarks semi regularly? That's horrible!
20	Its almost like climate change makes hot places hotter and cold places colder. Jeez, who could have predicted that. 
6	why did i expect this to be anything other than what it is
20	> On top of that, the article stated that some had even had their IUD ripped out by a partner. BLUUUUUURURRRRRRRGHHHHH WHYYYYYYY
6	I saw gluten free cat grass at the pet supplies store once. Did not know that was a thing
15	Thanks [NAME]!
0	He's hot
0	She looks JUST like that little girl [NAME] that won America’s Got Talent, the ventriloquist. 
20	I think it's racist to call yourself or anyone European. If you're born on Earth, you're an [NAME], separating yourself is Racist.
20	I never thought this fatality fit him, unlike [NAME] or [NAME].
20	And this comes as no surprise too anyone
1	Ha! Yup same-same! He was my first intimate relationship. I have had other drunk encounters but I don’t count them lol
5	Don’t worry! I was never convicted of anything!
20	>[NAME] well, there's your problem
17	4! The sweetest year.
20	intended is the word you're thinking of.
15	I do go to the school counselor once a week. Thank you for the suggestions
20	Oooo too soon man
6	Joat, mo nint. I don't question the dutch part, I question it being a staple/stable.
23	As soon as I read the title the music for this game started playing in my head.
10	Nope. Sadly early 30s
4	Beer bottles and his ex's old stuff. Because if country music has taught me anything its that all that exists is a gun, alchohol and some girl you lost. 
20	Man people say baseball is dragged out but football is realllyyyy dragged out
4	I'm torn between [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] is next man up for scoring now, especially if [NAME] keeps riding the pine. 
3	Because they aren't different subspecies
1	Ya done goofed kid. All you had to do was win.
20	Please be my guess :)
3	P=too damn high
20	Is she talking about his dickee?
2	I wanted to bring to others' awareness here to the site and its absurd name. I've removed the link now above.
13	I can see that! Let's say that I'm less enthused by that idea now than I was after Mania last year...
24	I'm glad you managed to find your own fun and most probably made a big contribution for this great ending. The whole masked rogue idea was amazing
20	No offense but...she's not pretty either so I'm confused why she'd say that car is only for ugly women.
0	That was the moment I fell in love with [NAME]. He was also really good in Frier Fall (Free Fall).
23	I hope [NAME] bullies wittle baby [NAME] tonight, like he did last year!
11	Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.
20	Yes, and they hire trade school graduates at much lower salaries. A University graduate is usually better rounded and more competant.
7	He could be spooked off by the camera crew?
0	right. cause it's real. that's why she has to talk about it.
20	*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** yosoyjackiejorpjomp! ^(hug)
8	>Being sexually desired False, since there are a lot of things you can change on yourself to be more desirable. Also you act out of experience.
26	Poor kitty! I’m sure she’ll feel okay again soon. Lots of TLC in order
24	Er - I have to leave quickly, because things might stay the same!
21	I'd be careful with that, could be construed as cybersquatting which is illegal.
20	They're men, they view the vagina as a hole to stick things in, they too have a hole to stick things in. Indistinguishable!
4	I like it when incompident workers phone in sick. They can't annoy me then

20	Oh by bad
13	Happy cake day man!!!
20	keep telling yourself that, women dont care. keep hypnotizing yourself with pornsickness, that will bring all the women to the yard /s
5	You’re dehydrated and exausted, drink lots of water and maybe get some sleep. You’ll feel better eventually.
20	Don't date broke/jobless women. I have a job and I always offer to pay the bill or split.
2	"Really didn't like. I thought it was nasty and mean-spirited. ""[NAME]"" on ice it isn't."
26	[NAME] was injured going into that game and then ultimately left in the second half after suffering another injury
18	See him live if you haven’t already. One of my favorites to see in concert.
20	I would love it if someone broke that record because that would mean Real would’ve gained another extraordinary player like him. Haha.
0	Congrats! That could not have been an easy step to take, so I'm so happy it's been a positive experience.
20	What if they’re just fans of Dukes of Hazard though... Edit: I forgot to /s. Lol.
0	There is nothing adorable about that terrifying man
1	It's a troll. Look at the history.
2	Ya i hate to talk bad about don’t but they should get the sticks out of their butts and make smarter decisions for their community
15	I'm doing a lot better. It means a lot that you checked in on me. Thank you!
25	And you're a lame, sorry not sorry 
20	ROI for that is too low. Truth is customers are willing to put up with shitty employees.
0	Both teams played fantastically defensively, just because it’s not a 10 goal game doesn’t mean anyone played badly. 
20	Oh. Well then.
21	Yeah I wish they could just finish 9th every year in the conference
3	I’m anything but little you little puppy kicker
5	You got whooshed fair and square. Take your medicine.
20	this was probably going to be my last thoughts on the matter
20	I thought archer was like the machine from person of interest. An AI that watches everything and stops crime in some way or deters it.
19	Jfc, that's depressing.
21	Yeah odd, as those items would identify her. And it would seem like an easier job to burn them to unrecognisable remains. 
15	THANK YOU SOMEONE SAID IT!!
18	I love crows!!!!
15	Okay, thank you very much! So we are off the deep end of Riverdale logic here.
20	now this is epic
23	We really need to stick to having helpful titles or a quick tldr.
9	Damn. So you went back to an old medication and found it no longer worked for you??? I didn't even know that was possible.
19	Oh man, there isn't enough popcorn to enjoy this.
27	Suddenly, I was awake.
12	I was trying to make a friend that was being a douche jealous by telling him I was having a 3 some. Accidentally messaged it to my father.
0	Thousands of people born every single day! But mine? Mine's a god damned miracle!
7	Fudd puckers? If it is that i when there last summer.
6	yup today hit me extra hard since im unemployed. i feel like im not meant to work, or meant to do anything really!
17	So PST it is. Glad we agree.
0	so basically free money for those wealthy enough to take vacations annually. wonderful.
20	I'm shaking in my boots
20	Then present an opposing argument.
15	Thank you. [NAME]
27	So you're saying there's a chance I'm a bot... I don't even know what's real anymore!
20	I'd say that the vast majority of the population is and was rightly looked on as horrific. Christmas music makes me feel like a real [NAME].
3	Yeah nuance is in desperate need. The world is complex. Simple answers using simple binary thinking may not give us meaningful political discourse.
16	At least he can now pay respects the ultimate way
3	Why is she the absolute worst
20	So are some women. A couple of my friends have this very issue.
5	I always worry about my facial expressions. You're not alone there.
18	I’d love that luxury of time.
20	Was there a new episode this week?
25	"I don't drink I don't smoke I don't do drugs and yet still am not ""happy rich and all that people say this brings"""
20	They do in the common tourist hotspots where our undesirables travel.
12	Oh my [NAME] that's so awkward
20	Game pass has a lot of good games you get aswell, id look at them first
20	Here puffing on the crack pipe isn’t a conservative value, kind of excludes you from this wonderful utopia you speak of. 
4	Damn, this hits close to home. Reddit is literally the only place where i can talk about personal stuff without being judged

0	This is fantastic! What an incredible gesture. Given the current fears British [NAME] are currently living under, this is a very welcome bit of news.
20	i'll take 2

5	Thanks, this means a lot! I will do don't worry :)
2	>it seems everyone is doing that now and I hate being One Of Those Women™. Wait- can you unpack this a little for me?

12	I was teased for being a virgin when I was a 6th grader- in 2005
8	Can’t see him doing well in the premier league tbh. Wouldn’t be surprised if he ends up wishing he stayed at Dortmund.
0	The right had both houses and the presidency and they wait until they lose the house to pretend they care about passing wall funding. So brave.
6	What is the chair in the photo? I'm torn between sex toy and torture device.
18	I like this sub, and I like you. You're alright. 
20	This is really well put. I saved it.
3	There were those god awful GoPro shots in the fight scenes where they had a shaky camera fixed to the actors facing directly at their face, though. 
27	I can tell you thought this damp squib was an absolute dinger.
20	I never thought about that. Good point. Cursed and wilted rose, unlike [NAME] rose emblem.
18	I am so pissed about Oiler hockey right now. Even [NAME] is annoying me and I love [NAME]. Gaaaahhhhhhh

10	Clouds aren’t pale they’re translucent but ok 👌🏽
2	But it's still raping infantry. The case rounds OHK infantry up close. It's just horrendously weak against planes now...
4	Contracts & money in rtts mean absolutely nothing. Just one of the many missed opportunities year after year
21	Imagine being upset by this
7	Do you have cash app?
11	How ignorant of to care about the safety and well-being of others! Shame!
27	Can we all pitch in and buy this place instead of the Baltimore House?
20	“[NAME] Created Men and Cheats Made Them Equal!”
20	second temple stood for 420 years r/trees /r/Judiasm crossover confirmed!!!!!
20	Just tryed choosing beggars. It hasn't taken the bait yet
6	Also it looks like this person might have a mustache. They look like they shaved their upper lip kind of mustache. I'm very confused.
3	"*Bride walks by* B: ""You ruined my wedding [NAME], great to see you!"""
20	Yes, and then look hurt when you glare at them for causing a scene and/or not being just as tickled as they are.
4	I don't think anyone deserves to be killed, no matter how terrible they are.

0	He's been amazing tonight
3	Stupid theory!
20	omg this is a bit too relatable
15	Ah thanks for the tip.
23	They won’t find my house once it’s painted in go-away green...
13	Ladies and gents, I present to you, your typical anti-gunner.
10	That’s a statement I can actually get behind. Not because of anything he’s really done, but that Scientology stuff is... weird.
3	I’ve gone through it before, and it sucks. I’m still a little hazy and withdrawn.
13	Congrats, proud of you ! Hopefully I can follow your lead and get myself out of a similar situation 
20	You're all insane.
20	Idk for fun?
5	Omg. I hope she is ok! Poor [NAME].
11	I've had sleep paralysis once and it is really bad.
20	The moment [NAME] got activated off IR, [NAME] got placed on IR.
12	Lmao I have like 12 days played cop farming who even does that anymore oh my [NAME] you’re pathetic for even bringing up ages
4	Women have a right to their own bodies. Your comments are horribly patronizing. They indicate that women intellectually develop slower than men which is sexist.
27	I'm sorry. I hope he takes the CTJ talk seriously. Fingers crossed for you!
20	Hello from America! Tell [NAME] I said 'hello,' as well!
26	Laws don’t apply when you’ve got money. Sad but true.
23	I thought it was that one! I recognize the shadow of the new highway arch and the forever construction signs.
8	Only blurred photos, but could be something I suppose. Here's to hoping
27	This person is going to be very surprised to learn how many college campuses require you to have UTD vaccinations...
20	No. We all begin in ignorance.
3	I can’t call anyone Daddy. Not even my Dad. It just feels weird and creepy and I’m not 4.
20	Then it was effectively them pissing on your territory. Same with the bed. They don’t get to pass the threshold again!
10	They listened in a way.. they just executed it in such a way that makes us pay 3-5x over what we should be paying for skins.
0	I know. I get that a lot.
20	[NAME] is a jinx. Please send him back.
1	LOL you are mental ,love it
20	Its worth the risk
3	Because [NAME] was playing awful in the first two sets. Absolutely terrible.
7	Was that before or after he murdered over a million [NAME]?
2	lol not bullying. Just a socially aware nerd complaining about how annoying most of my people are. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
20	Hes a daywalker!
7	Waiting to see if a card expansion will make the game fun.
21	I have visions of someone being at a [10] blasted out of their skull and actually doing this.

11	Because what you're doing is disgusting and an insult to humanity.
13	*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** melodesign! ^(hug)
23	Oh god, never thought of the implications of [NAME] not selling BB-8 as mirroring her parents giving her up. That tugs the heartstrings a little bit.
20	Can you read? It says right there the tweeter’s husband got out to help the woman and ask if she was okay
20	WOW!!!
6	No, you said you think she deserves whatever she can afford. Can she afford housing?
18	Still love [NAME]. Gave his heart to the Broncos for many years. Hope he can go out and win himself another ring this year.
2	Wtf? Really?
3	I can't see a way forward, neither the government or the opposition wants no-deal or to cancel A50. 
20	nope, this is just older people not understanding how teens actually communicate
20	"You're saying some surprisingly stupid things for someone named ""[NAME]."""
7	What makes it a non sequitur? The point is, just because someone is in the DSA doesn't mean they are a *democratic* socialist
18	[NAME] TAKE MY HEART
20	NEVER FEAR!!! [NAME] IS HERE!!
7	It's some freaky stuff for sure!! How legitimate do you speculate the experiments are?
12	Female INTP and i concur! Especially the kids bit! And the Adorkable!
10	That isn't really trolling to me. Sounds like a good way to get DUIs. And stop them I suppose.
13	I really like the AussieBum jockstraps.
11	Yeah I don’t think [NAME] wants you to fuck my wife/his girlfriend anymore you cuck
7	Did you do the frame check by yourself or someone else did it?
1	Imagine thinking you can learn what you need to about parenting from a paper lol
23	Hey, remember when [NAME] said furries are all catfuckers? Glad he's changed since then.
0	He’s one of the calmest goalies I’ve ever seen in general haha
6	Everyone just called me the bad guy and said they're glad she's marrying him and rejected me and that i deserved it.

1	I think that had to do more with not wanting to hurt the old man lol
0	I like watching old shows and movies and seeing old brands and how the logos and stuff changed.
4	Praise [NAME]. Hope his health issues have gotten better. Dude should be on a contender right now 😭
20	How pretentious do you have to be to say “idk if you know who that is tho” after saying what your favourite band is
20	Went to school with her son. She is larger than life in person. Always swaying gracefully. It was crazy.
17	This is the funniest thing I’ve seen today
8	I was expecting her to come in to work looking like [NAME] from the [NAME] show...
17	Overwatch. Dota 2. Rocket League. There are plenty of games that implement loot boxes well, and are the better for it. 
18	Fuck I love you prag
4	Only when going to sleep, already seen them all way too many times...
20	It looks a little like my 5th grade science experiment...
20	My dad has an irrational fear of the dark.
26	She has a disorder of sorts. Not only do you both need counseling, but she needs some kind of therapy. 
2	Just goes to show how stupid they are
20	And number one is the Steelers led by...Mike Munchak whom we're interviewing. Nice.
20	That's how mafia works
0	That's such a well said last sentence...
21	I hope you enjoy it!
3	I thought it was going to cut to them still trying to get it out of its mouth! When the kid was holding it again I lost it
20	It always reminds me of those really old SNL skits with [NAME] & [NAME]
19	I'm getting worried
8	"[NAME]: ""I wish I won't get robbed of a victory again"" [one finger of the monkeys paw curls]"
15	You da best thanks

4	[NAME] as a coach. That definitely doesn't make me feel old.
13	I switched to Ally and love it. 2.2% interest is awesome
20	Micklethwait Craft meats and La BBQ are right up there with Franklin.
4	Colts fan here. [NAME] seems like a nice enough guy but, holy crap, terrible coach. Buyer beware.
1	That'd be a funnier picture if it was just a picture of the floor with nothing on it
20	Because this creep wanted to put his hands on the girl.
4	Ok? I’m addressing your points here. Don’t worry though, your reply suggests personal attacks are the way forward. 
5	Same here, would love to help. Praying things get better for you and your family :)
20	This is almost 4 years old!
6	*Redditor for less than 30 days* New troll account, eh?
26	This is me all the time, a mixture of anxiety and dread.
8	came here to find the person who hasn’t seen this movie so i could feel bad for them
4	I know of two people who did the Keto and some intermittent eating and got off all meds.
1	Totally agree, except I usually (this occasion included) lack the pity haha.
6	What are you referencing?
15	yeahhh fellow new shift here too * high five *. Congrats!
17	And yet the next time [NAME] stirs the pot with some stunt like this it'll get major traction AGAIN.
26	This made me incredibly happy and incredibly sad. Sometimes this universe robs us of the wrong people.
10	They mean “wholesome”, not “‘nice.”
20	Seems like [NAME] got shot by the **japanising beam**
20	The shitty taste is what keeps you awake.
4	That actually sounds like it would help, I’m glad it worked for you and I hope you eye is ok now 👁💪🏻
0	That's a pretty cat. It would be nice if it could go to Rocky Mountain Feline Rescue, as they are no-kill.
17	Insecurities exist even for people that are attractive. Even hot people are just like everyone else.
20	Bullock and Warner are the only two dems (without an F rating from the NRA) that I could see running.
10	I didn’t think I was implying that you weren’t.
15	Definitely very messy. Thank you so much for your advice! Really hoping this works out okay.
20	It will be too late by then.
3	I just don’t see why he pushed me leave with him so bad just to dip when I did
2	TIL the Recession, Great Depression, Colonialism, War on Drugs etc. were created by socialists. 
20	That jawn looks lactose free. Get that cheese mixed in that jawn.
0	This is such a good game so far from literally all of BIG. THIS IS THE FUTURE BOYS!
20	VODKA!! YOU ARE THE REAL MAN!!
3	Kinda sad but... Okay then
18	I liked [NAME] updated “I thought this was a teaching hospital!”
7	It's interesting that you don't address anything but just come to troll
9	Is it just me or does the outro hurt your ears. The intro is a whole 12/10 but the outro just seems to hurt
20	Wasn't getting anywhere to begin with, might as well have some toxic fun with it.
0	this is stunning footage of [NAME] dressed as a sheep.... and now after beto parody twiiter account was banned... it was allowed back
9	That, and truthers. Like, why? It just makes everything else she says seem suspect to the average person regardless of how sound it is.
20	[NAME] was struggling against the taller Sixer's guards, got swatted on a lot of drives too even with [NAME] out with injury. 
20	Nope, not my department.
24	I'm glad none of you are GM

12	So now you’ve been given several answers.
7	Why wouldn’t the cops turn off the truck and take the keys?
4	I'm strange as fuck, and I didn't grow up with money.
20	On top of the animals listed, you can also unfortunately see foxes in Oatley Park closer to sunset.
7	What the fuck [NAME]! Are you easy to talk to? 29 years and you didn't see it coming?
20	And...peter thiel is involved. Color me surprised. (O negative surprised that is.)
2	I would play the fuck out of this game
10	Deflections don't help your cause.
16	I am so sorry to hear about your wife’s tragic injury.
3	Underrated comment right here.
20	Justice was served
20	They’ve performed it live together so maybe you’ve heard that.
4	We made a big raft of inflatables on Little Bay and listened to the Hottest 100. Good times. The water is finally nice and warm.
20	[NAME]? (joke)

10	There is something legitimately wrong with you
6	Did anybody else noticed the mom right at the end hand gesturing the boy annoyingly as if it had been his fault?!
4	They’ve performed it live together so maybe you’ve heard that.
20	I got the exact same message from tati yesterday ! She said on her twitter that it's definitely a scam
20	Just be glad he didn't make you wear it.
8	I'd love if Sony use [NAME] as [NAME] in a Venom movie. I want [NAME]
20	[NAME] doesn't have a rolling r lmao
15	I don't know where exactly but these pictures are really good. Keep it up!
17	Goodness, that shot of McDonald's is **super** old. It looks like a picture from the 90s/early 2000s.
4	No, we both know you are liar. Thanks for convincing me to block you.
20	That’s not the whole
22	That guy (his dad?) was so proud he threw that strike!
1	Everyone keeps giving me that advice haha. She's happily married to a really nice dude, and she is basically my sister at this point.
22	Yeah I'm hoping the different-colored eyes and long hair help! (S)he is a beautiful cat.
0	Myers Briggs test is like the star sign for a different kind of nerd
0	This is amazing. This is how Christmas should be.
5	Dude, I'll be your friend any time. Especially if you got Steam/discord. I will link u to our friend group's server.
15	THANK [NAME]
20	Yes it does. I kept doing this for 2 mins. But yes it can still be reassigned manually at the command center I'm sure
20	I find it sadly ironic that a man's job is to protect his family, yet if he's alone with his children they question their safety.
3	“I don’t need no more sisters, I got enough last year” *cut to shocked mid drag faces in the werk room*
15	Just found out. Thanks for the tip.
20	The one catch is they will absolutely slave drive you for that wage. But at least you're getting paid what you're worth.
13	Sounds like a fun game. Our home game around here is .05/.10. Its fun but not very exciting.
20	Of course. Just know that I know that you know you're a liar.
1	Duress I tell you, it was done under duress!! 
10	Don't read, it just gets worse! 
20	Ive already tried praying for vagina - you will find me on my knees LOL
20	So dumb it's genius.
0	Eastern European here. Very cool! We’re really all the same.
8	Really curious to know how you know what people are going to think in 500 years, you ass.
18	No one in particular....i mean to people who believe that [NAME] and [NAME] are actually in love.
4	The ideal is not to have hope but to act like you do. But if you must chose, pick the former.
8	Calling your own side the dark side, I knew there was a reason I fancied you.
4	I hope you stay as warm and safe as you can ❄💙
18	I like this. I like this a lot.
2	Women can't do wrong you fucking mansplainer
0	This thread was actually inspired by one of your comments
6	Gotcha! I don't know why I focused only on [NAME]. That's an interesting notion which I'll ponder on for a while :P
3	That's true for every loss except for this one. He's being really petty and hasn't taken the [NAME] loss well.
27	Why would they stop magicking away their shit. That seems more practical than a giant plumbing network.
3	It may get you pregnant so just make sure you eat all her birth control before hand.

0	i love folksy cities skylines man
11	Sure would hate to explain sodium and water to them as they sprinkle salt on their food.
0	That PP also had a much better first unit than this team has.
20	Exactly. My father is part of Homeland security and is furloughed. Homeland Security isn't completely shut down but they furloughed part of their work force.
6	Not what I’ve been told. I don’t know at this point though.
3	This idiot can't be bothered to comprehend anything that reads longer than a bumper sticker.
15	Thanks for recording a video message with AntiRivet like 3 years ago for me. Hope everything is going well.

0	Don’t feel bad for playing Minecraft, it’s still a great game and is starting to get kinda popular again.
20	...they needed upvotes. That’s what makes it underrated.
0	YouTube is also fantastic for this stuff too.
20	He has a kid that he pays child support and my 2 younger siblings that he also calls leeches
20	They don't mean it hurts they mean it's just bad and awkward. It can feel good but is nothing compared to sex with experience.
20	I want it!
21	I guess we're just gonna have to agree to disagree.
3	That would be rough my dude, cops are trained to aim for center mass.
0	Cute! Love it sister
20	>by highschool you know what is and what isn't socially acceptable ... Since when?
14	My mums told me about gunmen standing at the end of her driveway escorting her family to school, really shudder worthy stuff
15	You are correct. But sometimes you might have a plan or you have to improvise. I’m glad it worked.
4	I carry on an empty. But I also carry a single action. So don't make my mistakes.
4	Awesome i already havr an will definitly not be doing it in the future thanks for the advice.
20	you guys are getting a better pick that we are. take solace.
11	Twice in that article he implies these minority communities aren't ordinary [NAME]. It's disgusting.

21	Wish you could choose to just have two bottles of the Pinot Grigio.
4	Yes, I had to drive about 2 miles to the restaurant but I only waited 5 minutes. 
20	30% of the country are insane.
20	I can’t tell which shirt was 2 dollars or which was 5 dollars for example
9	Yeah, but nobody takes McD's hamburgers seriously. 
20	Given the current state of our relations with SA, I would submit that judges should probably deny bail to Saudi citizens accused of serious crimes here in Canada.
20	[NAME] doesn't really look hindered by the way she's playing and hitting. I hope she doesn't retire. [NAME] just playing amazing.
20	I'd ask him how he plans to spend his days once he gets out.
3	They keep teasing us with royal blue. It seems like it’s unofficially confirmed that they’re switching their color scheme back
4	Extremely relatable.
20	It's in the news. I think I read it in SFgate or maybe mercury news.
23	damn you were close
20	In the end it is just another day surrounded by fake fans. If people wana watch a team that never loses they should stick to NCAAF
14	My balls shrunk up looking at that
4	yes, i know that people think of me as some strange freak because i never talk to anyone and act so awkward in social situations
17	I am happy for you. No, seriously, I am.

17	Ahhhh [NAME], you’ve done it again.
1	It isn’t lol just saw a string of comments like this. Probably isn’t him though
2	[NAME] you are a freak.

2	break them. join the fight, stop fighting against the fight.
20	Just heard on the news that it’s reopening now. I’m assuming it was a little electrical fire so they evacuated everyone as a precaution
9	Omg lmao. Coming from [NAME] too is super embarrassing. I can't really say I feel bad for [NAME] though, he did it to himself. 
20	At least she showed a reaction...
7	Right? No one brattier than incels.
0	Long Furbies are beautiful
23	Launching a jab is a hard commitment though, right? Because I doubt you can react fast enough to seeing them jab and launch them.

0	This has the makings of a great painting.
20	>let’s take it all After all this time, people still don’t understand marginal tax rates

9	Fuck I needed this. I found out that after next Friday I'm going to be jobless...
22	If I can be a racist against whiteys, I'd be one. TERFcide and Mayocide.

1	*lol whats a calculator isnt that a person that calculates why would they have letters on them*
20	“I use to work here and I remember our policy was this!” Did I nail it?

1	Can we get a guard too? This is my dream.
7	Interesting. I recognize way more of the 2019 names than I did from last year. Any hope that means I'm getting younger?!
7	Why did you agree to it... Lol... I'd understand if it was kindergarten kids who agreed to some rules and later decided to change their minds...
4	The left solution is to make them all citizens and to buy their votes with welfare and to never lose an election again as they destroy America.
4	Pretty sure it was a joke bud
5	Good. I'm glad that you are getting help.
3	> [NAME] My god we have to stop with some of these advanced statistics, it’s legit getting ridiculous.

3	You’re the kind of guy I could really dig... a grave for!
2	Guys, even worse: He *paid* someone to set it up. Wow.

1	Please feel free to laugh at me if I am wrong but I have seen this movie before...this game is over.
10	Yeah but if you do have a problem you'll be faced with a very difficult decision.
5	She was going to her safe place in her mind

1	So 7 years of playing the game (started playing at 15 and is 24 now). Ridiculous.
4	love after lockup makes DOT posts look like the most sensible things ever!!!!

4	Oh god yes. Top quality cringe. Thank you for sharing
5	i’m running, hiding & avoiding this man. poor girl. her story is a sad one 
6	"Can we all agree to stop lending credibility by calling tiny fringe groups like these ""movements""? There are dozens of us! DOZENS!"
20	No the bubble is love. The bubble is life. With the bubble comes zero expectations and a sweet sixteen appearance. Such is life in South Canada.
8	I fucking wish
17	So now we have [NAME] King and The Prince. Nice. I'm not even mad with this transfer lol

9	I thought legends already started.
9	You are not the only one. I rage quitted UNO
4	No words, but a series of loud screams should explain this look fairly well
21	Try some other banks, maybe smaller ones, and good luck! Maybe get that deposit up a bit more, and borrow less.
20	Well I can feel it was mentally hard bringing myself to go full [NAME] and shit talking prior to the plate, but this is some cutting edge analysis.
11	These guys are playing hard to get. Gonna take off my bra, BLAST MY NIPS!
0	I was never a huge fan of her, but if they replaced [NAME] with her that would be the best thing to ever happen to this show.
20	Hope [NAME] is watching this but he's probably too busy snorting some lines
20	"""Stay in your lane, bro."""
4	Not really sure we could get salary's to match up
0	Glad that [NAME] continues to be himself even in a mystery fortress. I doubt I'll ever play another game as good.
20	Once again if you base your worth/purpose on some base primal act, you're pathetic
7	That guy who said that it's a good idea to never smile towards women you like? Pass, the book was ultra-overrated 
5	Haha be careful how you bring this up to him, maybe say you read his note, or he might think you’re out to get him
7	Dude couldn’t see he had a spool of hair growing on his face?!
20	Sweet, I've put that as location and took a note of that route. You fancy it?
20	When the player is reasonable with his demands and the team is reasonable with their offer, magic stuff can happen.
2	Uncle [NAME], you dirty old man.

20	Not on academical level, but on family and bonding and respect for people who have lost their dearest ones
20	#ERROR!
20	Well damn I’m going to the Buckingham today
4	When I was a kid and it was really interesting how you could do to make you believe that you need to go back to sleep.
20	This may be one of those 'pick your battles' situations. Him not paying tithing is HUGE. I would take that as a massive victory.
0	Great movie, almost timeless :)
20	Because it would be beneficial to her cause if he were. [NAME] scapegoat mechanism in action.
20	You need to stop focusing on him and focus on you and your daughter.
11	Why,? It’s natural. That’s weird af.
26	I feel shot in the heart.
5	##EVEN IF YOU DONT WANT TO WATCH IT, GO TO 40:20 AND WATCH FOR 20 SECONDS, I SWEAR TO FUCKING [NAME] YOU WILL LOVE IT

10	Being approached isn't a license to act a racist fool yourself
20	[NAME]?
20	If [NAME] is being considered for all defense, [NAME] needs more love too
5	Stop thinking about yourself. Go help someone and work hard at being useful. There's no satisfaction or fulfillment in self-obsession. Get over yourself.
21	"""AaaaaAAAaaaAAAhhh!"" I can imagine."
27	Oh my [NAME] your desk is fucked.

14	Things were significantly worse back then than they are now.
18	I love how the sun just decides its going to pull Australia from Earth and cuddle with us... If only it didn't burn so much.
3	Too bad that's not the case. I'm happy I'll one day die.
3	How comes when Chinese companies help build infrastructure in Germany it's a terrible risk to their sovereignty yet this is fine
20	That's why the OP was proposing a global tax law
20	Nothing will ever top In the Mouth of Madness (which isn't an actual adaptation but come on).

0	Lmao your posts are always good for an eye roll

1	More like he stole a joke they made.
21	Good luck with that one
4	Ive gone through very similar things...i completely understand. Praying wont do much, seek a therapist to talk about things
2	No man don't you see!? People just change genders all the time and celebrate how fun it is! ^^^/s
8	The last thing I want on my team are former Eagles players. Fuck that team, the organization, and the shitty fanbase 
7	Like the handout this guy got to build the stadium?
1	LOL how can anyone trust you when you pretend that you voted for [NAME] when your clearly racist against blacks. Your user name is strictly a lie.

8	We try too, but more often than not those who wish to discuss are not on the level, rare is a Lib here in good faith.
6	It looks like you might have some sand in your angina.
15	Thanks. I was leaning towards the 11:05 tourney at MGM since it's deeper stack and slightly longer blind levels.
15	Yeah I was citing the wrong statistic here. Thanks for posting this.
2	This may be one of those 'pick your battles' situations. Him not paying tithing is HUGE. I would take that as a massive victory.
26	Six shots on goal for [NAME] and still nothing. This breaks my heart.
20	VODKA!! YOU ARE THE REAL MAN!!
10	I would prefer this over her being a completely random person, which makes no sense and was a tremendous misstep in this family saga. 
10	/Steps into freezing night. [NAME], forgot my car keys.
18	I just love the fact that [NAME] is giving advice on Sex offenders
8	There is one teacher, and 3 paraprofessionals. She is overwhelmed, and I want to help.

27	I'm surprised [NAME] hasn't had a chance to be called up
20	Or, you can unsubscribe to the subreddit that discusses all the things you hate that actually pertain to the show.
20	Let people have fun

27	I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
20	I've seen [NAME] at the bars in Huntington a couple times and every time I see her I buy her a drink.
0	So? [NAME] was and is a far higher rated player than [NAME] as much as I like him.
20	HIT OR MISS
6	Well just the thought of it being named Katz but not being The Katz in New York would make me not go.

1	this reminds me of the time when [NAME] bought Bofo lol
1	What the fuck is this doing in a cryptocurrency sub

10	They absolutely dont know what love is.
20	[NAME] got moved cause hes a complete liability in the defensive end

20	She lied to all of us.
3	Hey man, if you need the Chiefs to lose to bring you any sort of pleasure I get it. But at least be classy about it!

0	Last week was her week. She killed everything about that episode
18	I’m impressed.

21	[NAME] is just another millionaire taking advantage of dumb people.
20	Population control in russia
6	Why cant I ever see these comments linking things until the day AFTER i make my comment

20	Oh [NAME].
20	Oh, [NAME] 
13	Calm down.
4	I ate 2 lots of rice a day, with chilli. I also had a bowl of high carb cereal. I lost 4stone. CICO, is real!

20	I thought [NAME] had said he hoped to stay in Ottawa? I'd love if they signed him though.

13	Sigh, that was beautiful 😢
20	And wr is not what I want us to focus on anyways. We got plenty of other needs

10	Keep dreaming. He isn't coming to this black hole of an organization.
10	I don't wanna be controversial, but the streak might end...
2	Drive thru is the worst. The number of times people would sneeze in my face at the window was infuriating.
21	Ok, so don't report anything then and keep whining on Reddit about it. That will surely help.

20	Same. I thought the lady was gonna cut their head/hand off by accident lol

2	The denials is crazy in here

10	Former HUD secretary? I'll bet he'd make a hell of a brain surgeon.
3	The village elders have not given a shit about the children for awhile now.

20	This can’t be considered cruelty free because now someone’s hair style is gonna suffer
20	That's wild. I was just at the DIA last week.

23	To be fair the lore is so nonexistent other than on Ubi’s site you could probably just pretend that’s the case anyways.
3	It becomes manageable after I get prep going. But first thing in the morning it’s always a mess.
3	Super dumb that people are downvoting you for asking a question in good faith.

15	"I like to answer ""CALLER 7, YOU ARE LIVE ON THE AIR!"""
21	I think we would have tried to, but [NAME], as we can see, is way too good to make us a bottom 4 team.

9	>I clearly have no fuck I clue what I'm doing hire someone
3	You have nothing to feel bad about. It sounds like he needs to grow up and start paying his way.
20	The problem with writing vague laws in 2012 and then implementing then in 2017 is that things are huge changes that have taken place in that time.
20	ah gotcha, you zoomed in a lot further than i expected.

0	That's an excellent point. Who would be a good '[NAME]' for the Oilers?

9	Boring way to get it and unfair with the rest of the pkayers
11	> your character is so yuck Thank you, for confirming my suspicions of who/what you are.
0	Brilliant, thanks so much!
20	Why not make a piece and send it to them?
20	Source? Wouldn't doubt it's possible though games like BDO can get pretty nuts with whales.
2	Makes no sense. What the hell are you trying to achieve ? Sound like a dumho
4	You must live in a cozy little bubble then.
10	That's unfortunate but can't blame that lawyer for doing his job.
13	Sell high!
10	Nothing good can come from knowing. Just let it go and focus on the relationship in front of you
2	Dont call your self pansexual if you've never deepthroted a pan.
15	Thank you. It was just an idea that popped up that I figured I could ask here before proceeding with getting actual legal advice
10	Dad doesn't need to be there for 12 months. But way too step up!
18	I’m gonna love it if that happens to me
20	That's what this seems to be saying unless something was lost in translation
20	Then again, socialists have never been *particularly* averse to the odd spot of murder, have they?
20	It really is a just lean back and watch things improve on their own situation.
0	This artwork is amazing! Only thing that bothers me a bit, is that [NAME] is wearing something that looks like Korean traditional wear as opposed to a kimono
20	Blizzard was working with Activision long before Hots. I'm afraid its too late now, to divorce.
6	I'm confused what you're crying about. The situation has very little to do with us.
3	"Can you update this 20th century ""meme""? I thought millenials were the ""entitled"" generation. "

20	Man up and get yourself a date with a different woman.
2	That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
20	[NAME] throws the puck to the slot for a cutting [NAME] who puts a one-timer to the back of the net
15	Thank you for understanding <3
20	You can be partners without being codependant, you can also keep your individuality without worrying or hurting your relationship. Its all about communication.

20	If that’s what I saw when I was on the brink it would make me do it.
0	This is great. Good Yard!
23	We will probably get our chance again next episode without [NAME] becoming a psychopath.
9	37?? He looks 47. Hard life...drugs and alcohol.
20	... and we are still in the EU ! ... [NAME] help us when we leave !

21	whoops I still hope they press that legislation though
20	Sounds like people who are making a career out of being part of the bureaucracy have come across hard times. Shucks.
20	v0.1.2 should have multiple versions, one of which preserves 1RN. Additional info on the linked page.
2	Oh I hate him even more now.
0	[NAME] was useless, aside from bandaging [NAME] up a bit more than she already did and treating [NAME], name one decision [NAME] has made smartly. 
11	I hate everything about this.
9	It's harder to find a decent picture of him
0	that's some nice evidence you got there.
5	Damn, women really are helpless little sheep, aren’t they? Best us men protect them. /s
20	Skynet has really lost its edge
7	Yeah...when can the neckbeard asking this question feel okay if he masturbates?
5	I'm sorry for you loss man. Truly I am.
20	"Pretty sure you don't know what ""hurt"" means"
23	I mean, the whole point of this sub is to complain about not having a plate ...
5	I feel your pain...
4	Oh man, I love [NAME]. She's so consistently good. 
21	Never seen an abandoned piss trolley at a bus stop in Armadale ever
4	Sure but its exclusion isn't some big travesty
3	That's an extremely ignorant thing to say
4	You’re not wrong. The post is mostly a joke 🤷‍♂️
20	If we’re not taking QB then we’re taking edge or defensive line. Honestly as simple as that. *Especially* with [NAME] as GM
9	i remember my grandparents seemed to hate each other. my grandpa had a hearing aid and when grandma starting nagging he'd reach up and turn it off.
20	I'm not saying your analysis is wrong or not based on evidence, just that the data it generates is not useful. 
20	Rare just announced they plan to fix it but don't hold your breath it could be a month or more
4	They didn’t you lying sack of shit. This sub has no moderators.
7	Is this our year ????
27	I wonder how [NAME] prepares his food.
20	good luck. I'm hoping to get hrt this year and be a girl for my senior year.
5	I wish someone would just run [NAME] or [NAME] open ice, it would be worth the penalty 
2	You're clueless if you think you and even 50 other people would protect you against outsiders without the implied threat of the US military being involved.
20	To piss people off probably
20	Honestly in belonged in 2016 or 2017. Fortnite and the little kids that love it are the only reason it gained popularity again and for so long.
4	Yeah but it is what it is. Apparently I wasnt as clear as I could have been either.
17	Congrats to you
4	This is a genuinely good point. It’s enough to take me from giving zero shits to giving a modest shit against them.
20	I think that toxic masculinity refers to toxic behavior that has misogynistic undertones.
21	Ah, pillars of society. No wonder MLS is so highly regarded.
0	Oh that poor man and children. I'm glad he was armed, may have saved his life.

18	i love these wholesome stories when they appear in this sub. nice one, OP!
1	i think you could say the chat about smelling their own farts was also added for comedic effect

20	Besides, you have no clue which ones I have and haven't done. 
4	You’re only as young as you feel 😄
7	Is your brother incel? Is your dad upset you came out ugly?
20	He needed to have sex with [NAME] to complete his mission, duh!
18	I love daddy long neck and crew. You won’t be disappointed when you look it up.
20	She doesn't have to pay anything this is just an opinion of a lawyer. No court ordered that.
6	Sounds like fun, actually?
26	Not happy.
27	Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.
20	Just from observing and polling people around me, they don't care.
7	it’s amazing how he is already just about my favourite skater ever.
20	SWTOR should be considered a boring single player game.
0	Such a good doggo, and no one gets to pet her and let her know.
18	This...is so beautiful. The stuff of dreams for sure. ❤️
20	Maybe even pay less with the UCP!
15	Thanks for the link. She actually likes some of the stuff!
3	Holy fuck youre pathetic. I hope you have insurance. Therapy is expensive I hear
20	The rape of one? Millions of women have been raped. Rape and murder is also a tool of war.
4	I LOVE google voice! IT's the only way I can get my parents to reply to anything!
20	Maybe that's why she was trying to buy a firearm. To lead the fight against the alien invasion.
20	Watch out mlk there's a sniper, oh no he can't hear us he has air pods on 
3	hell even clem would be if she witnessed it happen
9	I'm disappointed in you too.
2	I would say make it NSFW but I won't joke. We don't work here

7	Anyone staying up for [NAME] [NAME]? Probably gonna go in and out of sleep watching on the couch
1	That's funny because I used to hate him but researching more just made me like him more
10	Pilots omg... you are not alone there!
15	thank you so much <3
3	Well that’s dumb. The question is about this sub.
2	Arguably they do, otherwise they wouldn't be out protesting for support?
26	>[NAME] has urged [NAME] and the Liberal Party to allow cities to ban handguns. What a goof.
20	Just do intermittent fasting, then you can pretend it's an interesting lifestyle choice and make that your new hip personality
21	We haven’t heard from you in a while. Hopefully you and your kids are doing well.
7	Yeah I totally wasn’t going to until I saw this comment.
4	Yeah that was his mistake
18	I loved that show. “The [NAME] is back!”
1	I’m legit cracking up at the landlord part
20	And he'll still be unimaginably rich after the fact, so this has gone so far into edge-case territory where the unfairness doesn't really matter
4	What does having sex with someone you don’t love have to do with anything? People do that shit all the time.
4	How much carbon you're removing doesn't matter much if you're still adding way more than you remove.
20	 [NAME], this isn't a guy who built the railroads here. 
1	You seem fun
20	> ftw Awesome statistic. Made my day! Love it
26	I feel bad for that other little girl that was the only one not to get a puck
22	The Japanese and the British can do it well, but they probably get like 10x the funding per capita.
2	Damn you! Now all this dirty money is flooding Frankfurt and Dublin!
4	Thats my GOAT
20	I figured that’s a British thing. Is that not a British thing?
23	Which is why people sell on TPT...
4	Thank you for that. My gf jumped right next to me! 😂😂😂
4	Woops. I'll keep it that way. Never be tired AF and post on reddit y'all.
4	yes, agreed. 
20	Now that the game is over, [NAME] can go back to jerking it to Tampa Bay highlights
18	I like Kate spade
10	I'd take the bet of them not winning in the next 5.
0	That's the best catch I've ever seen
15	Opposites attract! I thought the same thing when he helped her cook Thanksgiving.
27	Wow after that [NAME] turnover, I've never turned off a game so fast
3	you're misinformed
3	that was a horrible mess with 3k skills
6	A good character driven story? I don't think this guy watched the same movie as we did.
11	I've always found it weird how popular Nandos is in Britain.
9	Yeah, the gauntlet ruins everything
23	He looks 10 years younger since leaving Old Trafford.
17	Hey, you sound like you're living my exact life. It's a good life. Enjoy sharing the love. 
0	Damn that must feel great!
23	This reminds me of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas!
0	As an Aaron Jones owner, I did hate [NAME]. Lol but I’d still like the hire and just pray he becomes more innovative.
17	That was fun
20	[NAME] injury, [NAME] coming back, leivo trade. Quite a few moving pieces
20	I think not including a question about favorability of [NAME] was a missed opportunity, given the questions are clearly written by someone involved in the rationalist community.
20	Shrug. Cant blame anyone other than your parents.
20	Was going to say, that’s common practice for most women’s health appointments to help deal with relationship abuse.
20	The shattered glass looks like a sassy elf
13	Woah! 4 new maps in a year! That’s so lucky!! Not like we got 10+ maps in 2017 for bf1..
15	My alarm is for 8. Thank you very much!
5	Of course you don't think it's relevant. Your empathy for human life is tentative at best.
0	Fantastic!!
0	hahaha. She is stunning though!
4	Probably, but fuck Reddit then. Personal safety is up to the person, not public opinion.
13	Oh boy yeah
0	Everyone was fine so I guess it’s okay

20	reaper was getting self healing from dealing all that damage
4	He claimed surv cuz he didn't want to be shot by the vig
15	Thanks [NAME]!
5	Holy fuck dude. Use the mute button. Your feelings were hurt with one message, now click it, thanks ^_^
1	You must be fun at parties.
20	#BHAW!
4	"Because eye witnesses have always been proven to be credible. ""Hands up, don't shoot"""
20	I peg the difference
20	True love, that's the way to go right there. Sex, drugs and Rock 'n' Roll
8	I wish I could make a garden
21	I really hope not. I want a more feel good intermission, I’m done with being yelled at by angry old conservatives. 
11	What kind of response is that it's so shit
9	So the watering down continues. When will the democrats stop losing the battle before it's fought?
13	Why the social anxiety? You are going on an adventure with friends and are excited not anxious
7	"I know, right? What an embarrassment that local news would call that thing a ""tractor""."
3	Your logic is pretty messed up and the pos assumption has zero to do with this. Centralized mining will cripple the ability to fight censorship.
23	I can’t see her cheeks...wait a min. Oh those cheeks!!
6	What does that even mean? How does one decide right or wrong with something so vague?
3	Damn it. Don't mention [NAME]. Just makes me sad thinking what could have been.
20	There aren't really any consequences of an alignment change.
5	Don't feel bad I am sure the otters are getting taken care care of just fine.
6	LOL how he not amused?! They dont like the truth haha
8	I'm really worried :( I sent a DM to them, I hope they will be okay... 
20	That’s not what I mean Him being a snack is just well
11	i once dipped a raw hot dog in chocolate pudding when i was dared too. it was dreadful.
9	Papaoutai still leaves me bald.
15	Where's my thank you for that flair, hm? This is theft.
0	Hah hah I got the quote was mocking him - it was so perfect it thought it was genuine. Quality work :D
20	He knows...its an open / poly relationship. You know what they say about making assumptions.
20	Be sure to do the promo and get your free scope mount and magazines.
1	Attempt to con the senate. This should continue to be entertaining
0	But it's soooo obvious.
27	Geez those heroes..
9	Oh sure. I bet [NAME] is sick. Sick of Skyward Sword.
20	Always love me some Rambo. Sure he's not as charismatic as Ox or Jenko but there's something so earnest about him.
15	Roger that thanks
6	I dunno man. Guitar picks and baby pacifiers both seem to enter the quantum realm as soon as their dropped.
17	I recommend here a kind of jazz bar that enjoy a meal and drink. Famous place in seoul
14	That’s what I’m terrified of.
20	Repost to “watch people die inside”.
9	It’s always easier for TIMs to walk around with their “tiddies” out. They’ve never been shamed for them.
17	Oh but they will be sweet photos to look at in the future.
20	Genoa likes [NAME]
20	Shoot him, or something.
20	Cough cough, r/gunners would likento buy you a drink for speaking the truth good sir. 
2	Mother-fucking legitimate, charity fireworks!
15	Thanks, guys! Most of what you guys said were helpful. I'll work on myself a bit and not try too hard. ☺
20	. For all of you highlight truthers out there, the shove is clear as day.
0	Yes that's correct, without TWDG no story based game would exist , but i still like LiS
21	correct, even if it's EX and has invincibility then your parry will win.
9	Our knight in shining armor. I'll miss those high socks
20	GG, you just found a goldmine
20	Wait is this the original template where all the satire comes from?
9	> The cold hard truth is that they are the source of most of the antisemitism in Europe. Citation needed.
21	Every day in everyway. If I am to happy with anything next thing I know I'm actively destroying it.
20	It's like how I feel after I eat McDonalds. Satisfied, disappointed, sad, full, tired. 
18	I love you [NAME]!
9	Given [NAME] viability prior to the 2016 election, I think the viability bar is set pretty damn low.
10	I take that part on faith. There’s no “proof”, but it’s also an entirely unfalsifiable claim.
5	Let it go, look to the future, do not live in the past
20	People don’t understand the word allegation anymore, or innocent until proven guilty.
20	Fecking THANK YOU. -- One Foot on Each Side of The Pond
15	I can't wait to see what us skilled workers get. Thanks government for telling businesses how to run and wrangle unskilled workers with no ambition.

2	Why would you cross while an event is going...
13	Fus Ro D..omg the sun is coming up
23	I didn't know that he did. Just Googled it. Dope!
20	Then don’t read it. You don’t have to make a salty comment.
10	Right? Doesn't even stand a chance against my milk 80% of the time
1	I'd put the Thielen TD against Packers as number 1. That was such an amazing play by [NAME] and [NAME].
3	[NAME] turned it into one, because they insisnt on being on the wrong side of history for every single god damn issue.
18	thats adorable aw
15	Yeah - we never had a fight. I'm glad we managed to end it in good terms. Thanks a lot for the sentiment, mate. Cheers!
4	...they needed upvotes. That’s what makes it underrated.
0	Incredible work and very unique, good for you
0	Some pretty dark shit man
23	Maybe we’ve been mishearing the word ‘starch’ as ‘staunch’
4	Cool story bro
20	I know they're probobly not good but I love charged hadoken into vskill combos/mixups. It makes her fireball more interesting than just a zoning tool.
4	I was once married and now I live alone. Some weekends, I don’t speak to anyone and don’t go out. Pure heaven. 
10	Only married once so can't be that bad. Not that it even matters
20	I’m actually feeling these commercials. Especially the young dancer dude haha. This is how you advertise to your demographic!
4	I liked it because [NAME] is a fat lard and he was pissed off.
3	The paradox is not working, then also collecting entitlements is still theft.
18	We love you here.
12	Sorry about that. I hope the fix is more appropriate. Thank you!
10	You arent going to be making 10 million dollars in your business, this wont affect you.
2	I bloody hate L3-37's name. it's literally L337. How much stupider can a droid name get.
9	That’s a shame. What’s worse, evangelicalism or Scientology? Tough call
2	That's no excuse.
20	I’m okay with the “expecting mother’s” spots. It’s not a women thing, it’s a courtesy thing 
9	At least he's finally done one thing right. Utter fucking disappointment at every level, by every metric.
13	Intelligences? As foreseen unorganized by [NAME] himself? I also like nuglettes...
0	What a goal
1	I’ve only gotta PC, so I legit googled this thinking that this was actually what happened hahahahahahha
0	Good thing he throws like a 6 year old girl, otherwise this could've been serious. 
4	What comment.. When he said I dont think so, or when he realized he was on TV then said I cant say 
26	Yep, lack of proper coaching yet again. Sucks we missed out on [NAME]. 
5	That's kind of sad to be honest.
10	If [NAME] is lurking here it's probably definitely not good for his issues
4	Yea... I'll have to pass on the carpool with a username like that
10	No, no the PTA has not disbanded!
15	Thanks, as a Vietnamese [NAME], I love cheap Viet lunches!
26	Ah yes, my apologies!
3	That was an incredibly dumb thing to do. [NAME] is an idiot for trusting her.
3	That's awful. also i think I just realized why I have so much trouble finishing the last bite of food. I get all anxious about it.
20	Haha yes I did
15	thanks for sharing.
20	Clearly they do know who to trust now.
10	thats just an unpopular opinion, and legally wrong.

20	Did you accidentally buy the Australian model of the camera?
4	In other words, being a woman but not identifying with your oppression. How special
20	It was in your op.
11	creepy, the only way to make it more creepy is to leave it on her bed stand table to find it in the morning. 
3	That's definitely sexism, same with that ad
1	You’re argument is so bad you’re now asking people to deny common sense because you can’t prove your point LOL super pathetic
17	I don't mind posts bashing NOED or DS. But I wish this one would make sense or would be funny.
20	Isn't this the same video already posted ? Not seeing anything different
8	All I want to do is stuff my face with pizza but when you cut you gotta commit
20	It's cool.
15	Thanks. People need to calm down and give QCX a little time here.
20	well, that took a dark turn
3	Ive faced the same immortal teams 3 times out of 4 so far. So not by much at least
20	This is extremely state specific.
20	You, telling me that changing the clock increment no.s took 1 month? 
18	Was a great interview! Loved the segment on them asking about [NAME] and if he actually had to go to class haha.
18	I really love this title.
20	You must make a killing as a Dublin landlord. That apartment will be rented 24/7
3	Toe boards missing, tripping hazards and netting not in place. You better have a retractable lanyard on that phone. Get back to work hand.
5	My rabbit had one just like this before she passed. I hope the animal is okay.
1	[NAME] should be used to getting booed by Yankee fans though.
20	I just don't see it.
23	I'm active here and hadn't seen it posted before, wasn't on purpose but maybe it means i'm not alone
13	I am so excited for tonight's episode! It's barely even started *_*
4	definitly whining my dude
0	lmao i love [NAME] what a legend somebody who really doesn't care what the public thinks i wish i could be like him

1	I’m not crying.. You’re crying!
18	Love it when the wife goes lets it go retro. Also love it when she gets that puppy waxed.
2	anyone rooting for anybody but [NAME] is my enemy for (hopefully this long!) the next month
17	Enjoy you Salad
20	[NAME] went form 4-12 to 11-5 when he switched teams. Coaching success does not necessarily regress with age. Athletic ability does. That's the difference.

18	I used to like [NAME] so much him and [NAME] were one of my fave couples but I’m over him and his BS lol
27	Really surprised I had to come this far down to find this!
7	Im about to order 1b-lsd today since thats all i can get here legaly and dont have underground conections to get real acid. I will keep that in mind :D
20	“Instagram might suck but it doesn’t suck”
20	You lost me at dogs.
20	Mexicare for All.
20	That's so sad.
26	It's sad that nearly everything seems ok as long as [NAME] told you to do it.
7	What...? That’s some real mental gymnastics to justify him assaulting her
10	For her? Nah
4	I did that a lot as well. I always loved going with her.
5	I killed. Last thing I want is to [NAME] don't trust [NAME] anymore, as he will always remember that he could have saved [NAME]
0	How generous :) you must really make them happy. Good on you for that
20	What. No.
20	The monster!
20	They just want to give you hugs mate.
2	[NAME] I hate Twitter
7	Unfollowed at least?

24	Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May he rest in peace. Amen
4	I've long completed everything I can and spent all my fight money. No Kage for me

1	He has been training for this 5k for about 20 years
8	I wish I could upvote this a thousand times
1	Thanks? Lol. Pairing [NAME] or [NAME] with [NAME], defensively, though? Yikes, to say the least.
18	It'll soon be loved, it's under control! 
7	So she goes to her little boy instead of doctor, I hope?...
6	Idk if I want [NAME] back but I agree with [NAME] ONLY if he keeps playing at this level by the end of he season.
0	Did it taste good; I bet it tasted good.
15	Thanks man....

22	Surely a regime that would kill millions of people wouldn't *dare* tell a lie.
12	Short and simple... More embarrassing being a janitor or being in the unemployment line?
4	The Guy just wanted to Make a Joke and I liked it
17	I was wondering if that would be spotted. It is from the movie Split. saw the image on Reddit and immediately thought of lions.
10	He's not a believer, so he doesn't see what he did as wrong. 
20	78% of child decisions goes to the mom.

3	That is insanity
17	Oh, it’s you again. Here: 
20	I see where [NAME] got his training.

20	[NAME] funny, girl.. not so much 
3	It's also had derogatory meaning for nearly 400 years. people with any common sense or taste will generally choose *any* other word.

4	If your friend ever decides to go public with their content, make sure to let us know. We're more than happy to promote them. 
26	I thought this was a torb skin and I was about to die
20	That is one adorable meow loaf
4	And on her birthday! She is a rock star for sure tho. 🤓
2	Reason number 1523648856 PFF is trash no one should take seriously
14	Thank you! Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself otherwise you'll ended up in your late 30s exhausted and unhappy!
15	Welcome to the future, kid. Unfortunately your mom isn't coming.
10	Trailers? We don't need no stinkin' trailers!
15	Thank you for this! :)

7	Please just tell me [NAME] is in the top four
7	"Excuse me, but define what a ""good world"" is"
22	My youngest whispered to me one night that I was as cool as [NAME]
0	I mean there's a pretty big community of people that idolize school shooters and rapists so you never know on the internet.
4	Right [NAME] I’m going to have to ask you to stop arguing with your other Reddit account [NAME] in every bastarding thread

18	haha love it!
26	I’m in a similar situation, but mine is my spanish teacher she favorites the boys, and she really just hates me
9	Wow i didn't really expect both the explosion and him to live
20	I don’t think it retains more fat but you can get bloated and stuff and retaining water will make the scale go up
9	She is an asshat for driving on the walkway but fuck these guys. They should probably find something better to do with their lives.
20	[NAME] needs to be be right next to the basket with no one around for that to work.
20	? ur slide is right stick

9	This feeling is so bad
13	Yes, yes, yes. Oh my [NAME]!
9	I’d crap myself if that happened to me.
10	It's not like UK monetary policy massively diverges from the Euro
6	> western values You mean liberal values?
23	I've found that people who say things like that are the worst at partying
3	Yeah I've noticed that. I probably give off Aspie traits to NTs but Aspie like traits bug me
4	Me too :D
20	It's weird that actual socialists will say that politics has moved far to the right.
7	So I heard. How is she, haven't seen her in a while.
9	Living is exhausting.
4	Yes it absolutely is, that's just not it's formal name. [NAME] commiting treason is absolutely a crime
9	I don’t *think* she’s awful, I know she’s awful. She has literally no redeeming qualities. 
8	I figured as much. If I were them I'd definitely be sceptical.
0	The effect has Tyus has on ball movement for us is remarkable
15	Damn girl, Stockholm syndrome is strong with you. All I can say is I wish you all the best.
11	Now she’s going to find corn in her panties for the foreseeable future. Poor planning! Tehe...creamed corn....
7	Umm... Dude. Have you seen this planet? It's half penis-monsters already!
20	Just as delusional as [NAME] was. The difference though is [NAME] seems to be putting on an act, tj is just that salty.
23	Honestly idk that she ruined a moment, she just changed it so it was a different moment between her and [NAME]
3	Hm why are there age restrictions on the sex toys? :P

19	You didnt even ask the parents if they agreed to let him in the back?
18	We love you!!!!! And we would love if you still made them
20	I would focus on being an enlisted Marine first. That’s what you’ll be doing for the next 4 years.
20	They are, our cows actually eat grass... and, no corn starch. 
20	Note to self: always remember to draw my eyebrows on before posting a selfie.
1	Lol. Go astroturf r/politics. We aint buying her leftist bs here
20	Oh I thought we were talking about a sweaty sausage placed between two soggy white buns. Soooooo... yes.

20	“Too many people have seen me naked... I wanna keep whatever dignity I have left.” 😂
23	In the cap era no goalie has played as much as [NAME] has the last 2 years on a per games basis
2	Verisimilitude, which here means, utter bs meant to help justify terrible favouritism.
17	Our games against San Fran always seem to have amazing finishes
27	I'm so surprised they haven't done it yet tbh!
10	Nothing cool about Infinite genders and Sexual confussion. Populism and Structuralism is interesting but as short term goals.
1	I like Derek. It's on Netflix and I was crying my eyes out and laughing hysterically every single episode. I was sorry they cancelled it.
9	Poor attempt for karma I think
20	"All of your examples are legal entities established as groups. The [RELIGION] Church and LULAC are a different concept then ""the [NAME]"". "

14	I tried doing this for my son but he was afraid of it.
20	The comment was so terrible. I can’t believe it made the final cut.
6	I’m still not sure how we managed to do that. Gas prices in this state has gone up around 70 cents per gallon since around 2013
20	I'd imagine it's a team of people in marketing.
18	Oh [NAME] this is atrocious... I think I'm in love
20	No, I mean actual policies. Not self-described image. 
20	"I was well expecting the glee with which much of the userbase here would celebrate roadblocks being put up in front of ""the other""."
20	I'm sure this is only because there's less people there
4	"My first [NAME] bio said something like ""I'm not gonna fuck any of you, so don't try""😂😂"
2	Yeah how dare the puck not magnetize to [NAME] stick. Not his fault at all.

2	I hated that smug ass lawyer.
20	I'll keep an eye out.

20	*When.* When he wins.
1	Stay away from the sub till then ahaha
7	Why on earth would that happen? Do you really just discard all reality and think of things in terms of a pantomime?

20	My introvert ass who wants someone to cuddle but needs to recharge after 5mins of social interaction
23	I had no idea it would hit me as hard as it did. It really changed my view.
20	All the smut at Target makes me cringe. That, and the very clearly politically-charged children's books.
20	Kinda looks like a boxing coach
24	Seems legit. Supremacy was big enough. In fact, it's hard to see the scale on screen with that size.
4	Cruelty free for animals anyway. 🤦

15	Wow damn this some good words
7	Ive got these too, any tips on how to remove/make them less obvious?

5	Oh dear.
0	Nothing wrong with that! Sounds awesome :)
2	Drive thru is the worst. The number of times people would sneeze in my face at the window was infuriating.
20	So you are officially saying that record cabinet was not searched prior to the day the key was found? Is this correct?
10	Dyscalculia. It's not that uncommon, especially in people with ADHD.
16	Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.

20	I would like to do that but imagine how weird it would sound to them if they didn’t do it? 😂

7	It feels like an ironic meme. How is this not ironic?
20	I could change [NAME], she need me in her life
5	I want to see him succeed. Mostly because his last name makes me think of the bad guy from Shrek
13	Wow that was ...mind blowing.
20	Ahhhh, the ol' cotton candy hat trick.
10	I refuse to believe any of this is real. I'm sure his agent will issue a statement that his Twitter and Instagram are compromised
20	His performance this weekend reminded me of when [NAME] came into the LCS, he would solo kill every single lane
21	Limiting the crypto withdrawl increases the panic
7	Would be really interesting to see how an FMT from a 20 year old would play out in the gut of 60 year old, or vice versa.

20	Is that even legal? Isn’t that signing under false pretences?

1	Wow 4K!DS Kaede looks kinda decent
18	Love those clips on YouTube, does this add anything to it? Considering Netflix's obsession with exclusivity, this is an unusual arrangement.

9	Dude that was in like October abandon all hope
7	I would guess from multiple communities if they are trying to win the war against the other group

20	OP is going places!
20	Petition to smite BuzzFeed and Vice off the face of the internet for the bs they post Thank you
20	"To be fair, ""Junior"" was released 25 years ago."
5	[NAME] fits at 3 separate funerals plus almost every very serious uncomfortable conversation I've ever had would indicate you're not alone. [NAME].
13	Cheers man, will be taking it easy for sure. 
6	he dribbles softly and loosely I dont understand why nobody has fixed it.
1	Good god there’s so many cheapskates here trying to justify it by insulting me! Pretty funny tbh
4	Yes. Ignore and move on
18	No but I've been totally been meaning to I fricking love [NAME]!
0	Stay busy with good things, hang in there. Just take it 24 hours at a time. You got this,
4	Why do y'all gotta be mean like this. They're clearly comfortable with themselves
3	"I honestly thought that they could have chosen ""bigger"" words than those, [NAME] clearly knew what they meant!"
9	I know one time I mixed stuff up and posted the slashes instead of the asterisks to italicize. Oops.
17	You can do it! live the dream!
2	yeah [NAME] can eat glass, that guy fuckin sucks
20	Probably a disclaimer so if they're 2mm short and your cut doesn't work, they can just point at the sign and refuse a refund/return/exchange.
23	Sure. But [NAME] was well aware of the problem re GST and didn’t mention it until he was filling in his pension application.
0	Shithousery of the likes I've never quite witnessed. What a way to end the winter break.
0	"Look, its a great study, but youve said ""Women arent as disadvantaged"" on the internet. Rip your karma."
20	*my sister and my mommy. they just edamame*
24	I’m glad I had a few margaritas before I read this
0	[NAME] and [NAME] are the only reason to tune in at this point. Happy birthday!
8	I want him to change and realize he messed up and he needs to do better
20	I learned about [NAME] about 1749485 times in medical school lmao Soap helped a ton but it just did not cut it after a while

2	He's transcended fuck-you-money to fuck-me-money territory
27	And people still support him....
3	In what fucking world is this drawing not bad
20	We idolized him despite mediocre play. Though, with [NAME] in the house he may have had less asses to run into and trip over. 
5	I mean do what you want but I've always thought that's a good way of getting pink eye.
27	Right? just like the shock I had in elementary school when I learned the KKK was started by [NAME]
25	I'd say we are a role sub at best, sorry guys just telling the truth
15	Thank you for sharing your experience. It adds much needed hope.
10	So we should stop caring about other people and only look out for ourselves. That DOES sound like a baby boomer!
13	oh! I have more ships this time! Niice!
13	Same. I see some people just look really friendly, or just familar. 
6	But how can a [NAME]?
20	It was the other way around. The actors started dating after spending so much time filming together this season.
2	Your just killing time now.

15	Elite Disrupter and Elite Stryfe. Also, thanks.

20	Alright thanks ill try, (but thats like dark souls on ng 100 XD)
21	Justice was served
3	Damn look at [NAME] and his insane get off. We could use an [NAME] now probably now than anyone on this roster.
4	Such nice, silly, warm friends once you get to know how to act near one. You have to learn the secret scratchy place too!
20	I got back at him, though. Him and that little boy of his.
2	I DEMAND TO BE PUT ON A PEDASTAL AND TREATED LIKE A QUEEN IF NOT I WILL SEEK VALIDATION ELSEWHERE AND ALL THIS IS YOUR FAULT
20	We sign [NAME] we are oing to the playoffs(barring injury) don't sign him, and that's a question mark(even without any injuries) 
17	Me too! And he was so happy to get that out of her back, he seems like he really cares.
14	I was worried about that too honestly
8	I hope [NAME] bullies wittle baby [NAME] tonight, like he did last year!
7	Can a mediocre bot invent Facebook?
5	Don't worry--reminders like this are exactly where grizzled old guys can help out most.
20	That has nothing to do with guys that just started with us this or last season.
20	keep everything well hydrated
0	That guy was definitely in the process of starting a cult.
20	This is my gift This is my curse
20	virtual hugs, OP!
2	We always look so hot headed at road 😞

20	[NAME] didn't have the n-word pass
10	You said the words I couldn’t find in my head. That’s what I was trying to say the whole time! Thank you.
5	Out of control by darude. Just get carried away by the sounds man
23	Enjoy spending yours oblivious and phony, slowly realizing as time progresses how very wrong you are. 
21	Ah Belgium ... being paid €500 by your employer, and only being allowed to keep €200 :)
3	Most countries function as a faux democracy I think. Especially in the USA whereby Congress takes lobbyists money it becomes more of an oligarchy
6	Not sure who they went to, but free in my state (Ohio).
20	Mom used to do it all time when I was a kid.
20	Isn't North Dakota more important? Or are they just the sacrificial canary in the coal mine?
7	I suspect there's a difference between people who have an interest in makeup and those that don't on this.

15	Yay, congratulations! :D

20	Right, but their wages *are* lower *because* they get tipped.
3	The one fucking thing my home town has contributed besides alcoholics and [NAME] and its a fucking backwards feminist horseshit theory.
15	thanks for clarifying, you put me into cardiac arrest for a moment
4	I agree, not to say he would be a favourite but [NAME] is very hittable, one good headkick is all it takes
0	Ah, alright. Solid lists, but I disagree with appointing a sitting [NAME] with only 2 years under his/her belt.
15	Thank you.
7	I wanna know about the sky being LCD! You ever hear the one about the [NAME] faking the return of [NAME]?
6	I'm not sure what you're speaking of, but I suspect it may be specific to your state.
10	I don't think this makes much sense for Sacramento.
2	Excuse me, I hate to bother you but could you please inform me what you find so aggravating about sea Lions?
27	"Redditor proves humans are only species to be exempt from evolution by saying ""hmm nah""! Scientists stunned!"
26	And I’ll admit I am insane for allowing it to happen but the passion I have for this guy makes it hard to cut off all contact.
20	makes no sense, troll harder
1	You’re a vet; you at least WERE poor lol. I’m a vet too dude I know the struggle.

4	Girl YES. My kindergarten come back Tuesday, and I’m hoping they remember my name and how to hold a pencil.

3	Chilling to think people can kick others under the rug and consider them burdens to do something like THIS
0	Yes, when I need to get my jush, it’s freaking epic.
27	It seems kind of bizarre that Canada is expected to respect or accommodate the hereditary chiefs, if the elected band leaders choose not to. 
12	He's just showing off for the camera there.
7	It'll certainly make Naboo throne room interesting.
20	Comparing [NAME] to a tantruming toddler isn't new but comparing him to one's *own* toddler is bizarre.
1	Lol you're so close to getting it, dude. So close. 
5	End this relationship NOW. And please learn from it!!
20	Then [NAME] insults [NAME] and he cries
11	Thats even worse than what you put up (no offense really). Your work is well done just a hideous design.
6	Where’s the bar on this canoe?
1	"Finally, someone that understands you don't just get to keep information from your spouse about cheating to ""protect them"". That's crazy to me."
23	I've never been there before so I can't confirm or deny but I would be really surprised if a casino only had limit holdem

3	I know. Maybe if they realize this, they'll stop using that app.
0	Wow, time to talk to the [NAME] about a FPTP alternative.
17	I stand corrected. As I said, wonderful charities. I will always enjoy GDQ, just not revalant to my experience.
25	Sorry, I live in the real world. Just because you don't like facts doesn't mean they don't exist.
4	and they are indeed made of gold. this seems like reasonable jewelry prices. or at least not out of left field for designer pieces.
0	Sounds pretty typical from Toyota really. Been hearing the same story from too many people. Sad really because they were always the best.
20	So she's basically repeating everything they paid CTR to say back during the primaries.
2	Goddamn right!
20	Thing is, some fans will *never* be happy. There is nothing that can be done to please them. That's the problem.
0	[NAME] and [NAME]. Both are really cute in different ways
1	No one is stopping you. I will laugh at you, but go ahead. 
23	Roids are a lot more harmful than makeup.
0	It'll still be beautiful! They'll just have to be prepared to get a bit damp!
20	Oh god, never thought of the implications of [NAME] not selling BB-8 as mirroring her parents giving her up. That tugs the heartstrings a little bit.

25	Sorry. I read that as newly white and it cracked me up.

3	Its hard to explain i feel everything is distant.
2	Yeah weird feelings too

8	Keep voting against your own interests. #maga!
7	Istn't there a trick about coating the metal with clear nail polish?
21	A hell of a player when he was at Grimsby. Hope he can pick up some minutes and goals again.
11	Another racist foul by the Raptors on [NAME]
2	You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
3	Most people don't believe I have aspergers because I look 'normal' everyone else just thinks I'm weird.
20	#BUTTLICKER!
20	He thought that was a good idea...

2	Worst case scenario here is he dodged a psychopathic bullet.
3	So edgy.
27	Just another day in the life of a Scottish football fan remembering that Sky Sports are absolutely shocking I suppose.
7	I'm sure that's a really important issue to you that consumes your daily life...
2	It's okay. One day you won't be so sad and angry, and people will still accept you.

14	The air can kill you at this temperature.
20	Black Twitter has a higher IQ.

4	Though i think i preferred it when it was artistic and gritty i still love that series. Listening to the audiobook he took the voices from. highly recomended
20	and everyone else is worried about themselves not paying attention to you
20	That's what I thought (landlord myself). Even if you rent a room to someone, still that's a bit extreme.
11	dude, your mom is a fuck-nugget, i’m so sorry you’re dealing with this 
7	What's the advantage of making it illegal to seek services that can be offered legally? Other than discourage an act based on its perceived moral implications?
4	Yeah it helps me too but I still don't feel well rested the next day
15	U/scottgal - thank you! Coming from southern US, wanted to make sure!
15	good luck!!

0	What a charming puddle of smegma.
20	Why? That's not helping us win games.
20	The original argument was that he said the n word. Now the argument is that he just wanted to say it.
15	Thanks for the explanation! And lol yeah that’s fair - ‘rag’ isn’t exactly the flashiest of terms!
0	Oh nice, gonna add that to the list. Thanks!
20	I don't know, it its fairly anti [NAME] after the bump stock ban. I'm still holding out.

3	I have to imagine the camera lens part is utter BS.
20	And then attacking you as a person when you say you'd prefer not to be stalked and murdered. Sorry but your friend is a problem.
0	look at that gym! Id kill to have one with such a nice view

20	I think a lot of those same people are just over it.
18	At least people don’t say “I’m taking my talents to...” like [NAME] did in the decision.
27	It seems strange to me that [NAME] is still unsigned this close to the season.
0	I hope they appreciate the fact someone is getting up earlier than them in order for this to all work. I appreciate you, and I'm unemployed.
3	Man I thought [NAME] was going to be the real deal. I wanted [NAME] gone so bad around that time.
20	As soon as he was about to jump I audibly let out a “dude, just don’t..”
2	Yes, but his function is unclear.
3	The cult of reason was very unreasonable. :D
20	this is why I have backups off site that they’ll never find...try as they will they will never disarm me
4	This dude was joking. OP is retarded

20	that' be dope! Like a bunch of arrows following him like Red Death had bats
7	What are the chances that [NAME] actually reads the report when it comes out?
20	I had an ex who was [NAME] and a drunk and eventually got into crack
2	If a woman forces a man's penis into her vagina, that ABSOLUTELY IS a crime. Not sure what you're smoking. 
20	Finally!! Just do it already, it's time.
14	OH [NAME] THAT'S TERRIFYING SOMEBODY SAVE US ^/s
20	I guess the caveat is that is a world championship offyear where not all players are available due to playoffs
11	Found looking through this, she seems a little bit gross :D
18	Me too! I was thinking about this yesterday.... I want to be in love again.😕
17	My dad was on 20+ narcotics for over 20 years. Now he just smokes pot and I've never seen him happier
21	You should probably just use the same soap that you use to wash your body. You can boil silicone sex toys to kill bacteria.
6	Not sure how kittens “lol” but I’ll take your word for it.
18	I love how it stops just before the impact

20	Really? I thought he hated Mou.
20	Did I miss something? I don't think she's announced yet. Someone could still beat her to it.

20	Umm how about “Sorry I tried to kidnap our son.” He could start there.

5	Help that damn cat
20	I've read an optimum of 3 years between live births and to wait 12 months if there is a miscarriage before trying again.

8	I wish [NAME] played like [NAME]

20	Money is always going to exist sorry

9	i dunno, you commit one little genocide and you never hear the fucking end of it
6	[NAME] has been injured for a while... No point in doing that comparison. Not sure if a troll or just new to football
20	We *do* deserve animals if we give them lovings! Don’t talk so down about yourself, silly .. that’s what that kitty would say !
18	LMAO I love hockey
17	It is a very common verbal tic among tri-state Italian-American women of that generation and older. It takes me back to my old babysitter so vividly.
15	Thank you!!!! for being one of the sound minded people here.
25	ah dang sorry. in that case idk.
20	You could buy a used car for the price of those shoes!

20	Ru has so much personality this episode
20	Cool! Just do yourself a favor and do not scroll...
25	Yeah me, I'm blaming my medication tho.
10	I don’t even like [NAME] that much but she completely failed to engage with his work critically. Her interpretations of his arguments were shockingly poor.
3	Everything. Everything is wrong with being hypocritical.
10	Apparently, his knees aren't as bad as we thought.
4	Because the mystery is solved if you see the end. The hands striking simultaneously and close together on the same side= beatsaber e: on Normal
4	The wilderbeast only hit muscles so they patches her up, cleabed the wound and gave her antibiotics
18	Oh no! That’s my favorite! Nothing like losing an organ to get you to eat healthier.
20	What kind of source has that info but not enough to say what would come back in trade? Meh... I'll ignore this one.
20	That's exactly what it was modelled on, MTV show as well. The pun was just begging to made so they did 
20	Ooook, time to calm down now.
20	PD would probably get us [NAME] so we would all get pump faked until you realize he got the wrong one. Exhibit A [NAME] -_-
9	i managed to craft that super early in the game and i was so disappointed that i basically could not get drunk
15	Thank you!!!! for being one of the sound minded people here.
20	Just read the text of this amendment. I am literally sick to my stomach from reading this. THIS MUST NOT STAND!!
20	I don’t believe so. I got it when the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit was in my city.
20	My bad, I guess I should've read the whole thing, from opiate yes 
20	You're one unusual table, dude. Edit: Have you ever tried testing your hormone levels?

7	What is the story behind your account name? Just curious.
6	Did he actually have anything planned or...
18	I love when kids get cocky and then fall / get injured. That first kid's smile and face plant is just the best.

9	You [NAME] did not make us look good at all.
3	Lol. Ill try but its just not fun anymore. Haven't dashed in 2 weeks. Busy day job now so no extra time for shenanigans

8	I need more videos of this cat, love its face xD
17	I was inspired by your post to grab a thing of Greek yogurt with pineapple I've got in the fridge. Hell yeah.

17	I’m just glad that the academy is FINALLY progressive enough to nominate a mediocre [NAME] biopic directed by a pedophile.

17	Damn that's a good-looking pizza
4	It is hard [NAME] damn work, making something this pretty look like a chump!
3	That's so frustrating but I'm glad you're all safe.
